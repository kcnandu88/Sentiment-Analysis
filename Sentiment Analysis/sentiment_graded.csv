0,"has all the info i need to keep track of my packages, highly recommended!"
0,i ordered this to be sent to surprise house store
1,this delivery experience was a joke!
1,"our delivery date has changed 4 times so far. very very frustrating when you need the product you ordered. i could have bought in store at lowes but have always been a loyal house store customer, but i wont do this again:("
1,you people are a bunch of fuck up's
1,why can't you just deliver packages like any other store. why do i have to set up a delivery time and deal with rude people on the phone and be here to sign.
1,shipper lost my lawn tractor.
1,you lost our rug.
1,the date for this delivery keeps changing to further out.
1,i was told when i ordered this item. it could be put in an old one could be taken out. i ended up doing it by myself to find that the freezer and refrigerator door do not stick clothes. i was also speaking to someone online about this refrigerator being a normal regular standard size i'm not too good with measurements. the person online told me the size i got was standard and it is very small does not have a meat department in the refrigeratoi don't know how to have this returns and this fixed.
1,there has not been a status update on my order in two days and the delivery range is four days long it needs to be more precise and i need to be kept in the loop more about where my package is and an estimated delivery date and time very poor customer service
1,"order placed on feb 14 and was supposed to be delivered feb 26 - mar 2. it arrived at the delivery terminal on feb 25 and sat there. the carrier committed to a mar 3 delivery and i received notification it was on truck for delivery that morning. however package never arrived so i called the facility and they said the truck had issues and it would be delivered that day, march 4. package didn't arrive so i called on march 5  and was told a truck was down and wouldn't get package until march 7th. "
1,"i have still not received my order. apparently you had the wrong delivery address, which i corrected last week. i have received no information, no phone call, nor any email about delivery failures. please confirm this message and my expected delivery date."
1,"product was damage on deliver ,.not happy at all at this moment ,really sucks"
1,delivered on 02-26-2015 is wrong i got call this morning that items finally came in lat fri. or sat.
1,constantly changing delivery dates. unreliable shipper. waited on hold forever. package sat in milwaukee friday and i was told it wasnt ready for shipping monday morning. as a logistics scheduler myself i find this ridiculous. i now have to wait until wednesday the 11th to pick up a tub that was supposed to deliver on march 3rd. never again will i order from house store and have it shipped to the store. extremely dissapointed.
1,shipment delayed for over a week from original estimate.  not here yet and no reason given.
0,"so far, so good!"
1,you are not honoring your dates
1,when i ordered i was told shipment between 3/6 and 3/9.  now on 3/9 told delivery now 3/17 and 3/18!!!
1,i tracked the shipment no problem there. the problem is with house store not being able to find my item for me!!! took an hour of waiting. and it had just arrived an hour or 2 before i went to pick it up.
1,not happy. not on schedule whatsoever.
0,so simple   thank you
1,"ups has delivered all of our house store orders to the wrong address package after package! thus, we have to go and pick them up!"
1,4 days no update
1,still no tracking info......
1,"heater has not shipped, exception notice not issued. costing $40~50/day to heat to 50 f. delivery now not till 18th. the $2,000 + this is now costing me for a $300 heater is a bit out of bounds. any immediate action, monetary or else wise will be greatly appreciated."
1,"why not sooner??
"
1,"as of mar/8, tracking details showed nothing after mar 4 . where is the merchandise?"
0,great
1,could be faster shipping
0,good job.
0,"simple, fact package tracking. anxiously awaiting delivery. 
thank you."
1,your carriers need to improve their tracking they at times take up to five days to update their tracking info
1,didn't get it
1,"mechanical failure?? i've had floor man here waiting and getting paid. first delivery was set for the 6th, then today the 9th, and now ups site doesn't have a date."
1,very dedicated driver
0,the shipping estimate when i ordered was very conservative.  i'm very happy this order is arriving earlier than expected.
1,how did the package just ship 5 days after i placed the order?
0,"very satisfied, will keep shopping. thanks house store"
1,the order was delivered before the tracking information was updated past shipping label created.
0,excellent!
1,when i placed the order on the line it said the approxitmate delivery date was 3/10-3/11. now it was not shipped until 3/9 amd estimated delivery is 3/16. my tile installer is scheduled for 3/13. this is the same reason i closed my house store credit card. terriable service.
1,my shipment has been sitting in little rock arkansas for days now and it should have been delivered to bull shoals arkansas days ago.
1,"delivery date march 6th, this is the 9th.via phone ups says i have no package to be shipped. 
"
0,"was easy to order , nick was very helpful. "
1,"no one called or emailed.
sloppy"
1,ridiculously slow even though this was paid for expedited shipping.
0,great job
1,wrong part.
1,"a couple of things:  1. my custom vanity top arrived broken!  now i  have to start again and reorder one.  3-4 weeks waiting with a vanity cabinet without top... 
2. the color finish is completely different from what i ordered: light coco,  #38050.  the top looks horrible displaying messy dark brown/purple brush stokes. i'm extremely disappointed. 
more, st paul cust service blames the mexican factory and cannot guaranty a finish that is even close  to what hd sales as light coco vanity top.  "
0,perfection!
0,it is a pleasure to deal with house store. you make everything very convenient.
0,thanks
1,no delivery date
1,just provide a link to ups.com. its an extra step going to your third party website...
1,"no llamaron a mi puerta, colocaron un aviso diciendo que yo no estaba, lo cual es falso pues aqui estaba esperando la entrega. ellos no me tocaron la puerta."
0,just received!    thank you!   very nice driver!!!
1,horrible!! suppose to be here on march 4 and has shown to be in sweetwater since march 2. now march 9 and i still don't have it. very unsatisfied
1,took forever to come. items i ordered from other website after i ordered this vanity already came. house store should use a more efficient transporter. this is a disgrace. today is tenth and nothing came yet.
1,"absolutely horrible experience so far and my product still hasn't delivered. seko has told me multiple times that i should be receiving a call from the white glove delivery company any minute now. that happened on 3/6 and again on 3/9. the tracking shows zero updates since 2/25, only that my product should deliver between 3/3-3/5. turn out that my product has been sitting at seko in el paso since 3/2 and has yet to be delivered to the white glove delivery company."
1,my order has been sitting in the delivery terminal for four days.  unacceptable!!!
1,"package looks damaged, driver would not bring into house, no phone or text regarding delivery"
1,no call as to when the delivery was to be made and the vanities were left in the rain when i was not house. one of the vanities had chips in it and can be seen on the damaged box that had a hole in it. i have to return one of the vanities.
0,great job! wish everything was this simple!
1,shipment not received as expected. status hasn't updated in 4 days.
1,"this shipment was to be in store 3/9-3/10
please advise as to why this has been delayed an additional  8-9 days"
1,"estes freight is a piece of shit company ! upon opening the carton, dishwasher was completely dented in and destroyed. thanks alot for nothing assholes !!!!"
0,"over all a good experience. product arrive in good condition. estes driver was very nice and helpful. thanks, jack welch"
1,"our order of rock showed up broken.  don't like this site for tracking.  didn't give specific date, just a date range.  awful experience."
1,ok.  the reason i'm giving so low rating is cuz my package got to my town when it was supposed to. but is still sitting in  a wearhouse.  now the shipment date has changed to 8 more days and it's like 5 miles from my house.  i don't understand  this.
1,"well fuck, guess i can just change my mind about payment too.  maybe i will pay today or maybe it will be 9weeks from now.  brilliant-"
1,it was not delivered!
1,the shipment traveled from mesquite to fort worth back to mesquite and then wasn't delivered on march 9 the original date. it has been out for delivery for 8 hrs now and still hasn't arrived.
1,driver did not ask for signature . just left my package out side my door.
1,i really would like to know a true status of where is my package.
0,process was wonderful but the tile was much darker in person verses the color palette online. can't use and will return.
1,i received your text hours after the package was delivered. never received a text that it was out for delivery. that system is awful.
1,"you told me mar 16 - 18 and i planned around that.... i would have donr it differently with this delivery date.... early can be as bad as late...

0,see previous
1,"i haven't received my package yet there's no way to be found,  where is it "
1,shipment arrived badly packaged and open. called customer service for for shipment pickup will have to re order item.
0,good service
1,required a signature for polyurethane- ridiculous waste of my time to stay house and wait to sign.
1,"first was given 3/6/15 as delivery date, late the night before date was changed to 3/9/15. i had arranged for use of my item on 3/7 (weekend)- then item didn't come til monday-  : love that it was purple- tracking notifications didn't work until after it was delivered. and parts not put together & no oil included..."
1,12 days from order date to pickup date is a little ridiculous!
1,package was late supposedly due to weather but was sitting in dalas all day friday which was a nice day with no road hazards it should have been delivered on the 6th as promised
1,today is the 9th my package says to already be delivered but gives the 10th as the delivery date. doesn't make sense to me.
0,love the free online shipping
1,"received 2 pkgs y'day on the 09th.  the 8×1 screws & the (2) 10pc electrical outlets.  now, i can let some of me work begin"
0,shipping was fast!
0,"great service, thanks!"
1,customers rely on prompt shipment of products for house improvement projects that are planned around tight schedules. there is usually only 2 or 3 days of leeway time. late arrival of packages becomes a nightmare for the customer and their contractors...
0,thank you for excellent service
0,"nice job, really seamless transaction."
1,i suppose to recieve my wine fridge on march 17. it is 7 days earlier. cool
1,my partial shipment was to be here today! it appears that it is misplaced in the warehouse! please find my package!

1,my simple order was split into 5 different shipments with 5 different delivery dates and 5 different charges to my credit card. i can't tell what's due or when.
1,"according to the tracker, it still hasn't shipped yet i have received it."
1,second time ordered. second time damaged.
1,no tracking information available at all for this package.
1,it takes too long for you to get the items to the delivery firm
1,since the expected delivery date wasn't until march 19 & it was delivered today march 10 i definitely have no complaints!!  a very nice pleasant surprise!
1,"expect delivery by mar 9, but no sign of item. ups can't give me the location of the package. it is a bad sign."
0,"i was always informed where my order was at.  it was very easy to find.
thanks"
1,"the package arrived badly damaged, and i had to refuse delivery. the item has already been re-ordered, and i am very happy with the way the problem was handled. thanks!"
1,still have not received packages.
1,2/10/15 have not been able to locate my order. tried ups tracking # no luck  please help..am starting to worry.. smokeyroe@charter.net
0,"""under promise and over deliver"" would be a good motto for you to consider. 

i received several notices that the package was in transit and the delivery date was well ahead of schedule. however, the package has been delayed for conflicting excuses.

rather than raising expectations and then falling short, a customer would appreciate your honesty and then be pleasantly surprised with such speedy results. over promising sets up all involved for less than wonderful experience...
"
1,"first it was supposed to be delivered on 6 march, then it went to 9 march and now it says 10 march.  so when will it really be delivered the date keeps changing!"
1,yesterday i spoke to two different people trying to find out why my package wasn't delivered and they couldn't give me an answer. this is very disturbing as i had sent and elderly woman who had no heat a heater and no one could tell me when it would be delivered or why it was sitting in little rock for 3 days.
0,i will not be picking this order up because i found another digging bar that is better for my job.  thank you
1,"package delivered a day late, received delivery notification 5 hours after item was delivered, one box was open and item damaged. "

1,"shipped it to the wrong store, no communication, very annoyed as i need the tubing asap. would give 0 stars if i could...... did not get a tracking update until today."
1,my worst experience ordering online.
1,"were was it delivered to? i did not recieve it. found out it was delevered to the office, it said."
1,the delivery guy just loudly dropped my 70+ lb package onto an item that was sitting on the the porch breaking it and just missing a glass end table. hopefully my merchandise isn't damaged.  very poor customer service.
1,damaged again
1,i haven't received package but showing to be delivered
1,ups is the worst!   i will never buy from a business in the future that uses ups for shipping.   1/2 day of bad weather causes them to miss shipping date by 5 days.  bottom line - ups sucks!
0,perfect execution
1,the package was so mishandled that when it arrived was thrown against the door so hard that the drill case got broken and the drill started to make weird noises inside the case. i had to return it and order a new one. very bad service from ups.

1,"i have had many items shipped to our local store and held for pick up and all have been very satisfactory.  i received part of this order and the remainder of the order has been in ""limbo"" the the comment, ""being processed"" with no further info since 2/23/15.  now the info given is that part (what part?) of the order has been shipped and the expected delivery date is nov. 13!!!!  how crazy is that?  i am not impressed.  judith ballinger  "
1,terrible delivery terrible tracking co
1,would be nice for all items to ship at the same time. makes it harder to track multiple items when they are showing up on different days.
1,house store please fire seko. its over a week late and they have not updated tracking or provided an update. i even called customer service and they have no explanation or update. i signed up for text updates and got nothing.
1,"horrible customer service. delivery date was changed twice. then package was delivered a day after that. driver called me to say he was running a little late, but didn't show up until the next day. "
1,this is taking to long.i wish to cancel my order.
1,driver didn't bring item in or ask where i wanted it put outside but told me where he put it. terrible service
1,it took way too long and it's still not at the store for pickup.
1,when package arrived at rac they didn't ship it out because veronica (dispatch) can't talk to oscar the dock forman had to call and they told me today @ 7am . they forgot again. missed work! still no package :(  wheres my grandsons playground set? maybe this afternoon. can't wait forever. clifton's dad. 575 626 3279.
0,"work out well,good delivery man. product as expected. good experience."
1,"shipping company didn't call on so called day of delivery (per tracking number). my husband took the day off work, so we called them and we were told they were coming the next day. please note that not arriving according to the tracking number and calling the day before you plan on delivering is not good enough. my husband travels far to work, and needs to take a full day off for delivery. the lady of the phone was not helpful, and quite rude. we did reschedule, but with no help from estes!"
1,"estes missed first delivery day. item was stuck in a storm in p.a. they never called me and told me this. i took a day off to receive the order at house. i set up a second delivery day at my work ( in albany ). 03/11/15 between 9 and 2pm. they missed that also. will cancel the order ! there tracking does not work either.

thank you!!!!!"
0,"first time, i'll be back!"
1,"hello! so, i have to say- the way this is all being delivered is quite confusing! i made one order- its all getting here at different times? and how many tracking numbers must i have? yes! very confusing-- i wish you could streamline this in some easy way with one email to confirm what has been sent- with the tracking number attached to each item instead of in the subject heading-- i know i can't be the only one who finds your methods-- bizarre and not user friendly -- which is ridiculous. thank"
0,"on this order, i saved the order number, sometimes the order number gets lost - don't know how easy the process would be under those circumstances. however every email pertaining to this  order has contained the order number -  kudos for that."
1,"i realize the weather was bad, but 5 days on hold in one location. that's way out of line. this shipment took a total of 9 days with the 4th thru the 9th held in knoxville. sad performance, had products come from alanta via ups at the same time...delivered on monday as scheduled."
1,no info provided since 4/3. package not delivered on 4/10 as your site said it would be. your service is getting worse every year.
0,very convenient.  accurate eta.  thanks...
1,"late delivery they said it was due to bad weather but there was no bad weather anywhere close to where the package started, where it went through or where it ended up.   sounded like an excuse."
1,"your shipping package was extremely disappointing.  i ordered a router, which was packaged in a thin cardbord box by the manufacturer.  house store though it appropriate to ship the box in a bag.  when i received it, the manufacturers box was no longer a discernable box and looked like something you buy from a flea market from somone who is selling items that ""fell off the back of a truck"".  come on house store, get it together, a shipping bag is almost never appropriate!!!"
1,the tracking number hasn't been updated in a few days and the estimated date of delivery was yesterday.  but i have no idea where it is or when to expect it
0,thanks for a job well done.  i like being able to track shipments online.  the frosting on the cake was having text messages sent to my smartphone.  i will definitely use house store's house delivery service again.
0,excellent. would order on line again
0,great experience
0,"great service, timely delivery

free shipping on order was much appreciated."
0,thank you
1,shipping date is 3 days past date state  on order.
0,the delivery experience is not complete without receiving the shipment. so far the experience is good but if i do not receive anything it will go down hill quickly.
1,"over the phone purchase; sales said it will be ready for pickup at store in 2hrs...got shipped instead. i went by store which is 1/2 mile from my work and was told i had to wait.........see you next week mr ryobi
ohh wait also i dont live in new berlin, tx i live in seguin tx"
1,weather was bad and updates were never available and when weather cleared package was delivered to mcallen way down south then i still had to wait an extra day to get package..originally package should've been delivered on the 6th of march and we didn't receive untill the 11th plus i paid shipping n it took forever to get here...
0,"great.  i only have  house delivery if an item only store pickup,  i go other sources for purchase of that what ship.item. i love house store shipping items!"

1,ups delivered to wrong address.
0,great experience!
1,"expected delivery date: monday march 9th.  today's date: wednesday march 11th.  info on my tracking number per ups.com: a ups shipping label has been created. once the shipment arrives at our facility, the tracking status--including the scheduled delivery date--will be updated.

shipping and tracking experience = very, very poor indeed."
1,"the expected delivery date was 3-5 days when ordered.   but now, after a week later, i got an email with expected delivery date with 15 days.   what a mess..."
1,"have tracking number, but according to ups, house store hasn't shipped package yet"
1,still not tracking after seven days
1,this was an expedited order that took 8 days to deliver while we had a rented aereal lift sitting awaiting the delivery. i don't think i will expedite orders through house store online again.
1,still haven't received item
1,the email you sent me with the ups tracking number linked me to this stupid navar.com page. what a pain
1,the shipping order indicates that all 5 packages were shipped. only received only 1 package.  your phone customer service representative offered no help other than telling me that the vendor will call me about the shipment.
1,delivered after 10pm. lucky i was still awake.
1,"still have not received
"
1,"the tracking number is not recognized by ups.  i can't confirm the delivery date.  clicking on the link on www.narvar.com (through house store's email link) only tells me ""just shipped.""  for $90 in overnight shipping costs, i expect better service."
1,"this umbrella was suppose to go to our florida address!!!i have tried for 4 days to stop but nobody could until today!!! the lady today cancelled this order and credited my account and rang up another umbrella to go to flotida with my table and chairs and grill which will be there soon. i will send this back to house store . the service i have received for this order was terrible. the lady who took order, ordered. 2 tables and the guy who changed it sent
table and grill to florida and umbrella
"
1,delivery person left it by the mailbox in the front yard instead of next to our house. anyone driving by could have picked it up and driven off.
1,shipment was on time.
1,can't rate the overall shipment experience yet. hasn't been delivered.
1,"package was left on hood of an antique car. i understand places to leave packages are rarely easy to find, but leaving them on a car isn't a great option. after my order was finally marked as shipped it came quite quickly, so i won't complain, but would like to draw attention to not placing items on vehicles."
1,did not find expected delivery date
1,your system is flawed.  to deliver 2 sinks and pedestals broken is completely crazy.  i am waitin still.  what about paying for a contractor to wait as well
1,the box was torn up and looked like it had been sitting in a puddle of water for weeks. the product was not harmed however the box looked like it had been thru hell and back.
1,i can not get my packages delivered.  i do not get emails that there is an issue with the delivery.  and dealing with the customer service online is horrible.  my wait time comes up then gets extended.
0,all excellent

1,it took 5 days longer to receive this package than the stated delivery date.
1,item was dropped and damaged.
0,the ups man that delivers to my apt is great. he always gets the product here in a timely manner and in great shape. please let him know that he is greatly appreciated..thank you!!! .lina
1,"this was the second order and it again arrived broken. my customer has been waiting two weeks now and will have to wait another week before receiving a new toilet. she is 94 years old and having her bathroom renovated for a live in care taker, this order is delaying the process. hopefully the third time is the charm. the first toilet had a hairline crack in the tank after installation and leaks water. the second toilet showed up as a broken base and no top tank. i've had to pay for three orders "
1,there should be an option to give no stars.. don't get me wrong the store is a great company to do business but the package i got is in a pretty bad condition with holes and foot prints.. i'm really disappointed i'm not even sure if i want to open the package because is can already see from the broken box  there are scratches on the table.. not a happy customer!!
1,its on its way however not to the address provided during the phone order.  unfortunately i'm no longer at this address and unsure how to intercept or reroute.
1,"the delivery date is ~8 days earlier than first estimate so i'm confused.  i wish it said where it was shipped from instead of ""just shipped!""  ups doesn't provide any information yet."
1,"i appreciate the fast delivery.  however, it is bad enough for me to haul over a washing machine to my 2nd floor apartment  by just using the stairs.  your ups guy brought the machine over to the apartment office which is a block away. considering that i chose your store for a competition that offers the same item for almost $100 less.  i thought your delivery service will be a lot better.  talk about bad delivery service.  i am not going to order a big item from you again.  "
1,i was given a guaranteed delivery date of 03/13 now it is saying that the thing has not even shipped yet.
0,"your store in ranson, wv is 10 times better than the location in leesburg, va"
1,"it takes house store 5 days to put it in a box, and ups 3 days to deliver.  tells me house store is not very efficient"
1,this has not been delivered to my house! where is it?
1,so far cannot tell where package is.  only that it shipped and the delivery date changed.  does not tell me where (track) shipment is.
0,great service
1,"the ""estimated delivery date"" is mar. 12th, but the item remains at the delivery terminal."
0,quick from order to deliver in the store. great service!!!!!!
1,1 of 2 toilets tanks delivered has a crack and leaks water. i checked all packages delivered but didn't notice the crack then. i will notify the store.
1,estimated delivery is now a month from when i purchased. the delivery date continually moves to the right so i cannot trust any date given. est delivery date has changed at least four times now. i have no idea when my item will be delivered.
1,"this texting the recipient shipping status changes is crap. it should link up better to the carriers tracking. i signed up twice to be alerted, and have never gotten a text until now. so my only text was 12 hours after a delivery that i already knew happened because i had to be there to sign. "
1,"house store says that i should receive my order anywhere from today and monday, the 12th - 16th and i better see it by then. now i want my order now every time i check your tracking number the delivery date has been pushed back now i want my order now. "
1,what the heck is going on. my order was on its way to the store yesterday and now its going to take another week to get it. i am very dissatisfied right now. someone need to tell me what's going on right now.
1,"24 hours at the store, and i have not been notified that i can pick up my item?  that seems too long to me."
0,"how come it's not here?
someone dropped the ball!!!
now i have to rent equipment to do the job i purchased this for.  purchased back in february!!!!!!!
"
1,the granite vanity top was broken with 5 breaks.  there is damage to the cabinet. our contractor is working here and a replacement was said to be 10 to 15 days.  i asked for a discount to the house store sakes price the week before we bought and was told no.  as a result you need to pick io the damaged goods and i will go somewhere else to buy a vanity so my contractor will finish.  as a side note we spent over  $12000 on our kitchen cabinets with house store.
1,horible
0,"great site. easy, clean and to the point. perhaps add the pickup and delivery addresses (or zip codes) since sometimes we have multiple shipments."
0,"everything was great,thanks "
0,great info . love all the updates . love that i know exactly when shipment will arrive
1,purchased two items in one order and received only one tracking order number.  received only one item and no way to tell where the other is.  the box was shredded and the packing slip was missing.
1,worried that boxes were ripped open but i won't know if there any damage until this weekend when my husband puts it together. hopefully all is good.
1,i only got one pkg today the driver didn't have the second...why were they separate..i can't use one without the other and then change the date of delivery in the afternoon...wth?
0,we love this service.  it makes perfect sense to ship to the store.  saves us on shipping costs and it also encourages us to purchase larger items.  customer service is outstanding.
1,package that contained an essential piece for a house renovation project was significantly delayed.

1,missing items
0,great job
0,i got my shipment much quicker than the originally quoted date.
1,once again ups delivers the package at a completely different house.  at this point i am still trying to hint it down.  last time this happened it took several hours on the phone and it was delivered 5 places down.

1,house store saying its not the package not there?
1,"this order was to be cancelled.  the installation company will be refusing it.  i needed black wastebaskets, not brown and contacted customer service three different ways after placing the order.
"
0,i'm a loyal the store customer! my package arrived sooner than expected!
1,"as of today, 3/12/2015, ups as not received item for shipment. so how cam it be delivered by 3/13/2015?"
1,delivered to the wrong address. called immediately and he said he couldn't come back until tomorrow.  absolutely unacceptable.  i had higher expectations for ups
1,is this a joke?
0,fast and very efficient. one time as scheduled!
0,great service by house store and ups
1,you screwed up my order... thank you so much.  you delivered it to the wrong city somehow.
1,"should have arrived two days ago.  latest ""update"" on ups site was a scan a week ago.  no clue where it is or when it's actually going to arrive."
1,says delivered and sender requested return ?  i don't have it  i don't know status i don't know where it is?

poor service."
1,not delivered.  was out for deloivery.  i was to get text message re delivery time.  no text message other than your erroneous message saying delivered.  ..
0,rug was very nicely packaged compared to the one i got from jc penney
1,should have been here by 3-16. multiple phone calls with no resolution. nightmare experience. easier to keep a customer than get new ones. will see what house store does to make it right!!! lowes looking better all the time.
1,your mobile website's register application pagis malfunctioning.i tried many times to sign up but every time i tried putting my phone number in the contact number the parenthesis for are code n prefix number break slash is not operating properly.
0,such fast shipping! great communication!!
1,my product was delivered yesterday and this tracking says not to expect it until tomorrow. the box was completely torn apart in the shipping process and taped back together. several pieces were missing including half of the hardware and the shelves were severely banged up with chunks missing out of the wood. i will not order from the store.com again.
1,came damaged. had to reorder.
1,in the estimated ship date i hoped for it to be closer to the earlier date instead of the latest possible date
1,"why did it take 3 days to ""process"" the order? amazon ships within hours. i didn't realize amazon carried this spreader for the same price, next time i will order from them, i would have had it already."
0,easy and efficient
1,"the shipment was incorrectly labeled as being 41.5 lbs, and the return sheet also shows an extended weight of 41.5 lbs.
the shipment actually consisted of a 4.5 not 41.5 lb bag of apple wood chucks.  i suggest you request refund from ups."

hard to rate if i don't know where it is........?"
1,"my order sat at the delivery terminal for five days, until i finally called. "
1,"still waiting on my shipment that should have been delivered over a week ago. delivery date keeps getting pushed back. i called house store and seko and was told they've been trying to contact me since feb 26 to schedule delivery. i never received a call, text, email or mailed notice.  when i spoke to seko yesterday the lady said she doesn't know why it wasn't delivered because it didn't need to be scheduled. she said it will be delivered today. still waiting..."
1,shipping info was never updated. package has not arrived and it is now past the delivery window. all other parts of this order that were shipped through a different carrier  arrived early. very disappointed. i will think twice before i order any large items from house store in the future.
1,box was severely damaged.
1,"your shipping dept discourages me from ever ordering a product through house store again.  i have spent a tremendous amount of money with house store over the years operating my remodeling company.  this experience is one of the worst i have ever experienced.  tracking the progress through estes, i asked them why it is taking so long.  the response was filled with attitude and blame towards house store's scheduling.  this is not good business.  i will shop at lowe's more often now."
1,"ship date has changed three times, it keeps getting farther away."
1,"sucks, i made this order about two weeks ago and the order keeps moving. i called house depo . com and tried to move the ship to address and they said no, it was shipped. i have not reiceved a text message update. last time i will ever order something from house depo. "
1,still not receive product
0,everything went well.
1,"i waited all day and finally call to see why they didn't call me that they were delivering they said they called my house number they have on file. that phone never rang but once today, my husband even took a half of day off work. this is a birthday gift for my 3 year old on march 14 and now they don't even know if they can get it back out to me tomorrow . the driver never called my house number if he did then it showed up on caller id and a telemarketer. i hope they deliver this by sat. please "
0,"i thought the safe was being delivered to my house. email, through web based help, went unanswered. unclear on the shipping process, a thief could have intercepted my safe for all i know! lady called from shipping( i guess), now coming on monday when website said today, friday. got burned relying on the website. "
1,"i am not sure how house store chooses the companies to deliver large orders like bathtubs, but this experience with estes was terrible.  they called to tell me of delivery date and time, they never showed up or called and then seemed confused when i called to inquire.  they blamed the weather but could not call to let me know delivery was delayed.   i would not recommend them to anyone!   when i buy something from house store,  i expect the customer svc to be high & it wasn't. "
1,tracking number is invalid and my order has been delayed by 13 days.
1,i was to have received a text or call when shipment was going to be delivered of course no one called or texted me. even had someone call me the day before to tell me that i would receive a phone call with a 4 hour window on delivery time.
1,i was given a 4 he window for delivery. driver never contacted me to ensure i was house to recieve product
1,"very slow delivery, suppose to recieved the package yesterday but see no movement at all"
1,"not once did i get email on est dlvy date, as i do when i have stuff shpd to my house.  poor, poor dlvy info"
0,awesome
1,"the window was not packed well, there was no protection on the front and back. the box was severely  damaged. i guess it proves that the window was tough."
1,"product was not compatible with other item, despite assurances from online customer service team. now working through the returns process. sigh. "

0,"as per usual, very satisfied"
1,delivered as per tracking details! awesome!
1,product was sent in a bubble wrap envelope and detector was damaged and unusable.  had to return it to the local store and needed to reorder the replacement on line.  requested the new one get packed in a box instead to prevent damage and customer service rep agreed and will ensure this happens.
0,was as ordered.  on very satisfied
1,package was delivered at 3:00pm placed on the door step.  i signed up for text notification of delivery but i got a text at 9:00pm.  so my 960.00 dollar package could have been stolen from my door step.  thank goodness nobody took it. not happy with that!
0,fantastic service. didn't expect it so soon.
0,great service thanks
0,very satisfied with the shipping process.  pleasantly surprised when i received the email that i would be seeing my order so soon. thank you
1,was not delivered at our house.  had to call neighbors to find it at their house.
0,"i got it earlier than they said i would ,delivery date was 3/13- 3/17 got on the 12th,was very easy to track it so i knew where it was in shipping process"
1,ups driver apparently cannot tell the difference between 155 and 115.  had to hunt up and down street on porches to find it!!  fedex does a better delivery job!!
0,"very informative and house store is a great company to work with.                jojo lake george, ny"
1,the ups driver carelessly left both house store ups packages lazily in plain sight with my gate open for anyone to steal.   we do have a package theft problem in the neighborhood.   the driver didn't walk the extra 5 steps to place them on my porch out of the rain and far mor secure and out of sight.  also didn't ring my doorbell.   just honest feedback.   this wasn't the normal ups treatment i receive and i get packaged here all the time.
0,"love love looove this system!!!!!
billion thanks♥♥♥♥♥"
0,"very simple, easy and accurate. thanks"
1,lets hope this order get to the right location the last one did not and was canceled and had to reorder
1,ups placed an update late yesterday that their truck was late and could not deliver the package on time.  the problem is i hired an electrician to install and it is too late to cancel.  ups was not helping in trying to resolve the issue.  house store has been great though.  ups said to contact the shipper for their fault.  unbelievable!
0,fast delivery!
1,"i went the originally because i called first and a gentleman told me that it was in receiving and they would go in the back and get it for me when i came if it weren't up front.  when i got to the store i was told they wouldn't retrieve my order and to come back tomorrow.  now an hour later i get an email saying it's ready.  you guys stink.
"
1,"everything above was very easy & smooth. except, i don't understand why he left my pkg at my alternate dlvry site. it's street level to my bldg but it is an alternate address in case i am not house @ time of dlvry. i was most certainly house @ the time of dlvry. the only explanation i can come up with is that the driver was just plain lazy & didn't want to climb 4 steps to the courtyard, ring my buzzer & wait for me to reply, take the elevator to the 6th floor, knock on my door & hand me my pkg."
1,package was damaged; lamp was broken.  i am returning to local store.
1,my order was received on the date that they said i would. it was received in a timely manner
1,"tracking email received day after package was shipped, almost before pavkage arrived. "
1,package delivered on march 5. store can not locate it and i was never notified. today is march 13 so i called about it after checking tracking online.
0,wow!  unbelievably quick shipping.  thanks!
0,awesome on how fast it was shipped to me
1,duplicates uses of the same tracking order...how is anyone supposed to know what is going on.  a package has both been delivered and is still in route?  there is no confirmation of the address it is in route to so it has been delivered to the opposite side of the country but is still in transit but where to?  never using online purchasing and house delivery ever again!!!
1,did not text me when delivered.  i signed up three times and it kept saying thanks for signing up then i would go back in to check and i would need to sign up again.
0,love ya
1,this is the second attempt to get this shippment to my house and both times this page states that order was delivered. i would like for the ceo of house store and ups to go to my house and look at the 2 feet of snow at my frount door and see if you see ups foot prints let alone a package. this is the first time i ordered on line from hd and i will not do it again. hopefully after your company desides that i'm not ripping the company off for a $50.00  light  i can go someware else to purchase
0,"fine job. 
"
1,"still wrong! this is supposed to be in georgetown, texas!"
1,the package was delivery about 3:30.  i didn't get the notice until 7:00 that it was delivered.  not much help
1,first time ordering online with house store and my purchases were delivered in a reasonable time and easy to pick up. only problem was the descriptions were hard to tell what actual color they were. i had to order both to see which one suited my needs.
1,"i did not receive this product. please verify they delivered to 2060 east lake rd and where they left it. someone has been house all day. it is nowhere by my front door.

thanks,

1,"i didn't receive my package yet
"
1,status showed delivered but package is not here at my house. we have been here all day and i've refreshed the tracking page and it updated approx 9 minutes ago saying it has been delivered and it is not here. we've been checking for the package many times today.

1,package was completly open on delivery. i hope that all the small parts are there.
1,ups comes after 5 i work just leave my stuff
0,thank you.
1,must of missed it but would like the option to speed up the shipping. i have no hot water and the cold showers are not popular with the family.
0,great service normally.
1,"box arrived broken open with rips in several places and missing the parts and instructions.....ups driver drove off before i could get the door open so suspect he knew the condition would not be acceptable, very poor work ethic"
1,"how do i track this order? no link, no number..."
1,the 2 - 32 oz. cleaner were damaged.  they leaked out inside box it was soaking wet when delivered.
1,"i'm honestly very disappointed - the time for when an order placed to filled is extremely slow. this is hands-down, the slowest order processing i've experienced in my many years of ordering primarily online. this took 5 business days to receive an order and get it ready for shipment.. i will not be using this again and instead will shop around to find a location that actually has the product in stock (for example, lowes has this same product in stock and is only located 5 miles from my house). "
1,the text to pick up the package was wrong or the associate was unwillknh to go in the back and look. either way 45 mins of my time was wasted.
1,please call my number when you get to my resident :347-607-4306
1,"the shipment has not been delivered.


"
1,one of the worst online shopping experiences i have ever had.   i might get it a week late.  the first one was damaged.  it is taking a month to get an item.
1,"information on order is totally inaccurate regarding delivery date. this is totally unacceptable. this order says 3/13-3/17 delivery
this is not correct.  sekt says they have no idea when and to call back next week.   very disgusted"
1,i spent $10k on a fence that is a week late! i email 2 days ago no response! i haven't got any phone calls at all!
1,it was easy to pick a delivery date but the status still says in transit when it was delivered yesterday.  i was called the night before and told i would get one hours noticed before delivery but they called when they were already on the way to my house about 15 minutes out.  fortunately my contractor was at the house and it worked out but i really wanted to be there to be sure it was all good and the right piece.
1,"the estimated delivery date was originally 3/12 to 3/13.  then it was 3/13 to 3/16.  then it was 3/23 to 3/26.  then it was 3/23 to 3/24.  the transport company showed the shipment arriving in san francisco on 3/12, but the house store eta showed 3/23 at the earliest.  it should be a 1 hour travel from san francisco to the vallejo ca store for pickup, not a 9 to 12 day transit time!  a customer service case had been filed on this, but this delivery service is very poor."
1,why did my delivery date change from the 13th or 16th to the 23rd or 24th?
1,"constantly changing the delivery date! was suppose to be delivered this week, but you continue to push it out! not happy! i would love to finish my bathroom! never using hd again and going back to lowes! what a waste of time! if it's not here within the week i will be canceling my order!"
1,"i am having a terrible experience.  order shipped 10 days ago and is still not at the store.  when i talk to the trucking company, they tell me that house store is completely mismanaging every attempt to schedule a delivery to the store."
1,wait time for delivery of table to hone store is too long...shouldn't take that long....never received text that table was even shipped:(
0,you're doing a great job
1,this is not what i expeceted from your company. i was told my item would be delivered in 1 week.... it's been 3 and i still don't have it. i was also told that the delivery company would call and schedule a time to drop my riding lawn mower off. now i'm being told it will be left at the end of my driveway. not what i was told!!!
1,didn't know where it was going
1,package was never delivered.deliverer carrier said my address was not a address. said incorrect when i called to locate told me it was delivered to front door.was not . i feel ripped of&out of money no one has called back yet too correct shipment or return $

1,my order was never received as indicated. according to shipment it was never in fact delivered to the jersey city location. attempted to resolve through house store online support and was told i needed to call back on monday because the vendor is unavailable on weekends.
1,it's the 2nd time i return my a/c because there's damage due to the shipping.
1,delivery tracking is not updated. pls. update your tracking information.
1,"package received. box worn and well traveled. box not even taped shut. seemingly grabbed from shelf, mailing sticker slapped on it and tossed in the mail. luckily product is ok. slight scuff but should not effect performance of drill. i should hope that you would take greater care when shipping to paying customers in the future. online shoppers might be anonymous but we are still people and deserve better respect.

1,you sent the wrong color and it's clearly defined in the packing receipt that it was suppose to be green
0,"i ordered this product when i moved into a basement. tracking was easy and delivery was on time as scheduled. i am rating it 5 because of the swift manner with which the order and delivery was processed and handled. as regards performance, i will rate it after using it for a week. impressed."
1,this order was cancelled by your customer service dept because it didn't take my gift card during the order .....but you shipped it anyway...fail
1,no reason to take that long to receive a shipment. this amounts to house store being cheap. i wasn't given an option to pay extra for faster delivery.
1,"so far horrible tracking system.  date has changed 3 times and the local site where the product is allegedly at states it can not estimate date of delivery.  so, what good is this system.  typical house store style."
1,"they would not deliver within the estimated window. went to shipment dock/warehouse my self. they did not load car, loaded this 300+ lb shipment in the car myself."
1,it was supposed to be here the 13 th of march then the 17th now the 23 or 24 th this is bs!

1,"will never online shop with house store in the future, if i'd of know that the order would take one month to arrive. i thought the product was coming from a warehouse in the same state. wow!"
1,"i'm very unhappy about the length between my order and the arrival date. 
"
1,i purchased on feb. 28th and was informed that delivery would be march 9-11th. last week it was changed to march 16-17 and now it's showing mar 23-24. this is an unacceptable delay and i'm not able to repair my rental property and make it available for tenants.  i would like to be able to recommend house store online but due to this experience i don't believe i can.

1,where is it???
1,where is this thing??  i was called for delivery last friday and it never showed up.  its hung up in memphis?
1,no one called me to set-up  a delivery time.  i signed up to receive text message updates but i received none as well.  it was very difficult trying to contact the carrier and i may need to cancel the order.  i'm very disappointed with this experience.
1,1 star for shipping nothing was of truth to delivery still not here to my knowledge!
1,"recvd wrong size, reordered correct size."
1,"i called to cancel this order an hour after i placed it, at least the person i talked to said it was cancelled... apparently not.  overall experience?  house store online sucks.   this is my first and last time using it."

1,"delivery date was stated as 3/13/15.

1,"estes shipping company is a joke, the store could do much better."
1,still hasn't arrived and no one can give me a delivery date
1,package is way late.
1,i rejected the shipment because the box was ripped open and there was evident of both water and rodent damage.
1,no real tracking available. item has been in town for 3 days with no information or movement. i guess you are done when you get your money!
1,wont order on line again.  every time is a pain the the butt.
1,my shipment has been in transit 4 days without knowing where it is in-transit.
1,two weeks?  seriously?
1,"i have been in chat contact 3 times with hd on this order, i realize demad is very high and possible shortages, but a real status would be good, instead of stating it shipped, but no ups tracking data. "
1,"the tracking process for hd is horrible. i have ordered 3 things online and all 3 the tracking never updated until the item had been delivered. in fact, the tracking number attached had shown an item had been delivered days before i had even placed the order!!!! all items arrived safe and were well packed. the tracking process is worthless though."
1,this package was in 4 different p.o.'s in tenn. then 4 different p.o.'s in tx. what is going on anyway??? how long is this going to take?
1,"cant tell when products will arrive as tracking says ""exception"" and nothing more. says expected delivery is march 3 but has said that since when i placed order"
1,delivery is delayed even though other ups packages were received .
1,can we please get an update regarding this shipment. thanks.
1,i had indicated on my order detail to place pkg by side/rear door. the package weighs 95lbs. driver placed it in front of my garage. i was there and asked that he place it at those areas. he refused in a rude manner. he had a hand truck and the correct place of the pkg would have taken only a minute or two. i cannot move this package and it is outside in the elements. driver only laughed when i asked that he move it and drove off. this driver has made me a fedex customer in the future.
1,"i think you made the shipping date number too big.  it gets on the ambiguous side.  i am using mobile, iphone.

the shipping was excellent.

thx"
1,"when each order number is opened, it should show all the items shipped.  we have a considerable number of items ordered, so it is difficult to know what items each number represents."
1,it shouldn't take 5 business days to receive a package traveling just 2 states
1,"i knew exactly where my package was and it was delivered on the date it said it was going to be , very pleased"

1,if it was delivered why haven't i had notice of it yet????
1,"if there were an option for o stars on the delivery experience i would click that.  tracking status said friday the 27th last week as early as wednesday.  i spoke with estes 3 times, and even took the day off on friday.  i also clicked on the ""receive shipment status updates via text"", but have yet to hear anything from them.  i had to contact them on friday morning twice.  long story short, i am going to have to take another day off. "
1,"make your app, don't pay some weak 3rd party vendor.  this app blows"
1,"the tracking details you have provided make no sense, i have received only the single door, still waiting on the double yet your details are so confusing that they don't reflect what actually is going on"
1,part of order missing. no contact for local delivery company
1,very poor communication telephone carrier at 6 p.m. requesting driver to call person in warehouse responding to calls was not using english as first language my number was incorrectly given to driver driver never called package delivered 7:30 p.m. after waiting all day
1,very poor communication the warehouse person could barely speak english and did not relay my phone number correctly to the driver i'm very hesitant as if i'd ever use the service again
1,"this is terrible, you can't get out of it to move on to your tracking."
1,"status never updated until after delivery,  and i received no text notice as promised. "
1,"horrible so far and still not here! was told out for del 27th feb, didnt arrive sue to weather, was told on the 2 mar am def will be there today, called again at 5.45 told the driver is running behind but on the truck and will be there in about 45 mins, will def be delivered today! its now 7.06 and no delivery and cant call as offices are closed. feel like its not important to anyone that it gets delivered at all. terrible service and may not use house store again for items that need freight del."
1,"apparently when this site says between two dates, they actually mean that it will be shipped after the window closes. thanks! "
1,"still waiting. piss-poor service. chatting with the representative, useless. miss lowes."
1,house store texted me in the middle of the night at 330am with this survey. you should email in the middle of night but texting wakes people up.
1,"it stated delivery 2-23 to 2-26 when ordered, then changed to 2-26& 2-27,and now it show 3-10 & 3-11"
1,we were told it takes about 1 week. we'll it's going on 2 weeks and now it is going to be another wrek#
1,completely inaccurate delivery time frame.
1,"package was delivered one day after expected date, not really an issue at all but, was surprised not to see package on day it said."
1,i was not aware that this was a curbside delivery my package was literally left in the side walk!
1,order was stated delivered. store seems to not be able to find. i ordered online because there was none in the stores. very unhappy costumer.
1,"driver was very nice helpful. no where on the house store order conformation email does it say i had to contact the shipper to set up a delivery date so i waited for the shipment that was ""intransit"" for over a week before i hit the second tracking # and it said to call for delivery date. not very user friendly . need to let buyers know that we have to set up the date. "
1,two of my parcels were never delivered. 2 100665611 854689001595 1200-watt compact design ceramic space heater.  i only received half of my order.  not sure how to escalate but this is unacceptable.
1,"order out for delivery at 715 am, delivered at 730pm on the porch of the house. no call or text from delivery man even after operator assured me earlier of it."
1,"when ordering this product, over the phone with house store, i was told it would be delivered in 2 or 3 days. after spending 2 weeks just to successfully order the product - due in large part to outdated, wrong information on the house store web site, waiting 5 more days put me behind schedule and angered my customer."
1,"why has this order not shipped, today is march 2nd, ups label was created 2/13"
1,product arrived broken and is being returned.
1,received text mssg on 28th telling me pkg delivered on 26th?
1,i had never had anyone who couldn't find our address.. ridiculous! doesn't ups use gps ???
1,"the package has been sitting in tx less than 15 miles from my house, yet not delivered to my store.  the weather was not an issue.  amazon and even slow jc penny has had faster service this past three weeks.  i mailed things to maryland that got there quicker than this.  crazy.   still waiting on package...."
1,order was due on feb 27 not delivered until march 2. maybe a weather issue
1,"late delivery,suck ."
1,"item was damaged because it wasn't packed with sufficient packing material to protect the item.  the item was just in a plastic bag and no foam protection, which caused the item to break. while all else was great and i was excited, the broken item ruined the experience."
1,"please delivery by wednesday, march 4th am"
0,"this tracking service is fantastic.   the text updates for significant stages of delivery, the ease for setting that up, the prominent and convenient display of the ups tracking number, the beauty of the layout of the delivery status page.  everything about this app is stellar. 

your developers are great.

(i am an executive at a major research university, specializing in customer focus for an it organization, so i know of what i speak.)"

1,i've waited since the 18th of february for this order to be shipped. it is march 2nd now and today i finally asked for a refund and went out and bought the items i needed at the store and the order ships same day that i asked for a refund! not happy i am going to have to return the items now.
1,i was house and they always leave my stuff on the front porch and not knock on the door
1,i had to go pick up the item had ubf been miss sorted and never made it to house store i was disappointed
1,the first update i got was 5 days after my order had shipped.
1,"ups left this delivery outside of the back of the school, after hours for anyone to steal. this is completely unacceptable."
1,"one container was cracked on the inside of the box; no outward damage to the box, but the weed killer granules were leaking out of the box.
everything else was great."

1,i went by there and they said the package is not there.  the clerk said someone will call me.  it's march 3.  no phone call. the quality of the service needs to be more emphasized. no since of urgency
1,"paid extra for package to be delivered by thursday 2/26/15, but was delivered until 3/2/15. too late!"
1,house store very slow shipping i always buy things online but house store takes too long
1,"some of the vendors are not in any sort of hurry to ship products out, overall the house store experience is pretty efficient. had a few damaged deliveries @ house and in store, quickly handled however. so i not amazed but satisfied !"
1,"unfortunately, i ordered 3 boxes and only received two!"
1,ups is not the one i would like shipping my purchase in the future.. fed x has been to my house twice since this order!!!
1,the store took one hour to bring me my floor.. they said it was because they forgot and were sorry.. what!!!the shipment took too long
1,"seko int'l dropped this on our driveway without any notice or ability to check out the freight.  a large hole was torn in one side of the box, and splintered a wall inside the cabinet.  not pleased!!!!!  no notice of pending delivery, no opportunity to ascertain condition of $500 item. i will not order from house store again!!"
1,there are no real details on my delivery....do we just sit and wait and wait and wait.  how about a delivery window of no more than 4 hours.
1,only took 32 days and 3 tries for them to deliver to me.  what an embarrassment for hd!  would never try this again.
1,terrible.  suppose to be here between feb 26 and march 2nd.  now it is march 4th and have not received a call or any notification of when we might expect our purchase.  complete fiasco.  will never order from house store again.

1,our shipment came late and broken. estes was awful.
1,i when to the store and they don't find my order they don't know where it is !!do you believe that somebody know where is my order ???
1,"slow shipping, terrible tracking"
1,"house store, you have made this far more stressful than need be. the tracking number provided by estes delivery said it was being delivered today so my husband took the day off. now they are coming tomorrow, and they won't give me a timeframe that works with school drop offs. they told me i don't have a choice. not a happy customer after spending $3000"
1,"we had to call carrier 3 times.  we waited all day for delivery person to call.  they finally called late in the afternoon to confirm directions.  they called back later to say that they wouldn't have time to make our delivery.  my husband had to drive 30 minutes to meet carrier and load the snow blower into his truck to bring it house.  we had to get it out of truck bed by ourselves.  in view of this, our delivery experience was awful."
1,we were expecting the shipment on 3/3 as scheduled. called customer service that morning and they said it had not reached delivery store yet (on line check also said same.thing) item was to be delivered at my vacation house 1 1/2 he's away. luckily we had to go to this house on the 3rd anyway. got a call at 2pm and time was delivered 5 minutes later. we were expecting a 4/hour notice so we would be.there. the delivery people themselves were professional and courteous. we were very lucky that we
1,just because the local store would not stock the storage shed that i wanted i had to order on line and pay an extra $149 for shipping.  i at least would like to know if it is am or pm of the two day guesstimate on delivery!

1,the 50 lb. packagfe was delivered to # 6 not # 4 which is 1/2 block away. several other packages were properly delivered to #6 with a different name on label correct for #6 but wrong for #4. do they not count? do they not read?  on your navagation devices put in cornwall lane has oiut of numerical sequence addresses! (for past 50 years)
1,i received notice of delivery from ups 2 days before house store said it was shipped. it should be the other way around?
1,my complaint is with house store. they didn't tell me that i would have to sign for my order of paint until after it was shipped. i couldn't be house during ups delivery hours so i had to reschedule the delivery to  a ups pickup terminal 30 miles away. the hours were only between 7:00 and 8:00 mon-fri..
1,i just check this package's status. but i did not receive this package at all. i am wondering what i can do now.

1,the guy that drop it off didn't knock on my door my wife was house he just put it on my step and drove away
1,well ahead of scheduled delivery date. needed it for weekend diy project. couldn't be more pleased!
1,received shipping email after item delivered
1,i was under the understanding that all 3 of my  items were coming today
1,"i ordered 3 items the tracking said would be here 2/26 and so far only 2 of the 3 items has been delivered even though all 3 items are shipped from the same company together so there's no excuse for ups to deliver all 3 items separately and make my project get delayed when the weather and roads in dallas have been clear the last 6 days and they didnt even have the last two items on the truck together to save time. very poor customer service handling of speed, and disappointing.

1,my only complaint is  i don't have a receipt
1,ordered three different times and damaged in transit all three times.
1,march 9th??? i could have gone to the store and bought one by then. crazy slow shipping for a simple item.
1,this part of the order included two turnbuckles. very sloppy packaging. box way too large. three bolts and nuts for the ends of the turnbuckles were missing. not very happy.
1,package was delivered broken
0,"shipping was easy, jusr open my door and there it was."
1,the item received was on damaged condition.  the shipper did not use any additional packaging material to protect the glass lamp.

1,"i had emailed regarding my delievery of a steam shower (tracking number ste67510461) and asked to be notified the day of delievery being our package weighed over 700 lbs. come to find out, my tracking status still says in transit, and i came house to the steam shower dropped in the middle of our shops driveway. blocking access to the garage and out in the weather. not only was i not given a phone call, the delivery man placed this enormous package in the most inconvenient spot. i am upset!"
1,"vague info, no details, already late with no announcement, thus fairly useless. "
1,after the delivery date had come and gone i called to see when our item would be delivered. i was told 2 days in a row that seko needed to do a dock check and they would call me back. both days i did not receive a call back. when i called the third time. i explained that i was not going to accept the answer that a dock check was needed. after she checked i was informed that our item could not be located and we would need to cancel our order and start over. order placed on feb 7. today is mar 4.
1,the worse tracking system i have seen. the terminology makes no sense to customers.  no info on where the package is in the shipping process.
1,horrible delivery service and your customer service department is horrible too. they couldn't figure out when my packages were going to be delivered. my items were left outside my door. no bothered to notify us of when the delivery was going to be made. i signed up for delivery messages and i never received any.  i wonder what house store would have done if my packages would have been stolen.  my husband has very bad back injuries. i struggled putting my big heavy packages in my garage.
1,my cabinet was supposed to be delivered between february 27th and march 4th. it's now march 5th and the delivery date was just updated to 13-16 march. bad service.
1,due to incorrect shipping documents by h depo the delivery has been held up for a week. we have been on the phone for hours trying to sort this out. poor experience.
1,no delivery on original tracking eta and now eta is a week later (getting a day later each day i check). no eta on trucking company's tracking site...

1,"most awful order fulfillment experience ever. i have no idea where this shipment is. vendor delivery estimate varies dramatically from shipper estimate. estes tracking says the tracking number is ""invalid"", and all this page says is that it ""just shipped!"" for every time stamp 'update' shown. substandard service and one i will not be using again."
1,this package is taking too long to deliver...not happy
1,what the h@5$ is going on?  this was promised to be delivered on march 4 or 5!!!!  now it is more than 10 days later?????
1,"i have contacted house store 2 times. my address is not  correct!
incorrect: 31794 
correct: 31704
the street and zip are correct

proper address should look like this:

susan lambardo
31704 iroquois dr. 
warren, mi 48088"
1,"the page needs more colours to separate the categories of info, and headings that say: shipment status, and description of what the item is in the particular delivery. right now the only colours are black and orange, and besides looking like halloween info, it is not that easy to quickly find the info that the star ratings above refer to."
1,was notified delivery would be on 4 march.  today i was notified delivery would not occur.  no future delivery date was provided.
1,horrible. one week late. delivery date changed. no tracking notifications . even though we requested tracking notifications. our first notification was when the doorbell rang. wasnt notified that the delivery date was changed
1,the delivery was good. 3 of the 9 azaleas were in poor condition however
1,i don't receive my package to comment on my shipment delivery experience
0,my package was delivered as scheduled and undamaged.
0,like the tracking feature
1,it would have been nice to know what or about what time it was coming.. it is now 7:50 pm and still not delivered...
1,the box is torn and corners are bent. ihaven't opened yet to make sure it's not damaged as it is for another house. i will know more when we deliver it next week to that house.
1,"shipment to house store store is much too slow. once at the store, i have to wait until the item is logged in. only then do i receive an email from hd to pickup item. by that time, well over a week+ has passed for something as simple as a toilet paper holder. online ordering was only alternative as the item was available only online."
0,outstanding
1,"this has been the worse experience! because the gentleman who took my order didn't enter my email address correctly, i have had to continuously call and check on my order. first phone call was to see where my order confirmation was later that evening.  that's when i found out the email was entered wrong, but also told that they couldn't change the hard copy. so i've had to call almost everyday to see where my grill was.  the email address is most important when placing an online order. "
0,a plus
1,takes too long for delivery
1,"could not find status on website, called store, they say not delivered.  tracked with ups number, site says delivered???????????????? going to store to find out/pickup"
1,"ordered 2/24, not shipped for 6 days and additional 8 days to ship. this is not all due to weather. i am disappointed"
1,weather delayed.
1,"(location history should be shown like fedex tracking does.)
found that info - just had to click +"
1,shipping was fast. package arrived undamaged.  online ordering and shipment is the best way to purchase.
1,"order had 6 weather delay days and was out for del today but shows tomorrow now so if i get it , that will make 10 total days it has been in delivery status. the other two got here 3 days ago. it will be the worst delivery experience i have had. i do understand weather issues but ups is slow compared to fed ex as far as my delivery experiences. i also know it was not house stores fault. thank you for your time."
1,did not receive tracking info until product was being returned for non-delivery.  never knew attempts were made for delivery.
1,"one box was missing and apparently was damaged during delivery.  house store was easy to work with for the refund however, i should not have to reorder the product myself."
1,"i purchased washer/dryer and the stacking items all at once, but they are now arriving in parts. i already received my washer/dryer and have no idea when i'll receive this part (without which i can not install the others). i will now have to set a separate appointment for installation, this now will have me waiting for delivery/service in two separate dates, plus the overall time to start using y appliances got delayed. "
1,"i didn't receive this order
going on 2 weeks
i wouldn't even rate this 1 star but i had to"
1,useless
1,unable to use tracking on ups site.
1,the outside box was torn and the inside box was cut to the point of coming completely off......
0,got a text message it was at the store drove by and up with no issues. just what a order from on line.
1,"i ordered this item on march 3, but the tracking has a bad delivery date of jan 13 (delivered sioux falls, sd).  the item is in transit, but the main screen shows ""delivered"", when of course it is not.  there seems to be a glitch in the system, or at least a bad entry. "
1,i have not received this product. please advise me of the status.
1,"wanted to buy extended warranty,but was told this purchase did not come with one."
1,"package left outside in drizzle.  package staples were opened.
"
1,delivered to wrong name; wrong address number; wrong street.  very poor service!!!
1,"item had zero packing to protect the item. 
"
1,would be better to link directly to ups website from the shipping confirmation e-mail.
1,my delivery was delayed because of a commodity description. what is this. i was expecting my package today. it is a gift.
1,received in 2 days to my door. . great service.
1,"this was a great experience, it makes up for the experience i had in the store having to buy a more expensive one, which i really didn't want. i will be taking it back when i pick this one up."
1,"i only received an order confirmation never one with tracking info. when i did receive the tracking info email, i already had received the product. i'm still happy though. it's house stores fault not ups."
1,tried to straighten the mess out but the chat line was more interested in rating the chat
1,"when item was purchased was given delivery date of march 3-5. now i find out that you have only just shipped it?! your website needs to stop promising delivery dates for items that you can't fulfill.after spending about $2600 with you on this bagger as well as a d155 mower, i hope to be able to use it before the grass is so long you lose sight of the deere."
1,tv arrived damaged. house store then demands more money for expedited shipping because of their mistake. asinine. refund demanded and never again doing business with them.
1,you didn't give me the correct date. you didn't call to set up delivery. package was left outside in front of the garage where it could have been stolen.
1,this site does not update.  delivery window has already past with no estimated delay time.
1,"first tib came in damaged and had to reorder.  was told by the store, one week for delivery, now this page is telling me two.  i can't actually ""track"" this item with the tracking number either.  don't think i will order from house store again!"
1,i haven't picked up my delivery yet but am impressed with how i was notified and  how much sooner my order came in. just hope it is  not damaged because this is why i had delivered to store to check it out there that seems to be an issue from reviews
1,the delivery date was march 5-6 and then changed on the 6th to 16-17 of march. now i have to reschedule contractors which will delay the remodel by weeks.  not happy at all!!!
1,"i was told my order would arrive on march 6th, it didn't ship until the sixth. i have one very unhappy client to deal with."
1,this is crazy it was supposed to be at the store today now it's delayed until 16 how
1,"trying to get this information, was ridiculous. first, the information was not available until now? look at when i placed this order. so, i go into the store, to ask if they can find this information. they have zero information, even when i presented the order name and numbers. dealing with your customer service is a joke. after multiple awful experiences, with different large item purchases, i will definitely seek out multiple consumer reports websites, to post and share my experiences."
0,driver was extremely helpful
1,was not thrilled with house store feeling the need to send a text that my shipment arrived at 3:10 am. woke myself and my husband up. perhaps pass that along to them. thank you!
1,when i called the delivery information number the assistant said the delivery would be march 6.  does anyone know what is going on??  does anybody care???????
1,estes says we will deliver on friday.  wait wait wait.  call call call. no estes. so 9hrs later they say we deliver on monday
1,"this order was sitting unshipped for over a week at the vendor. i called house store to find out what happened, and then it was finally shipped.  frustrating experience. may not buy from house store online again. "
1,drop and run without even ringing doorbell is unprofessional
1,"i know there is bad weather, but there has been no update on this shipment since the label was issued on feb. 25, i.e. 10 days ago, on both your website and the ups tracking website. can you give me any information as to whether the package has shipped?"
1,way to long to get this product.. have not received yet and should have never taken this long.  will not order from hd on line again..sorry
1,the status was very slow and your supplier was not diligent in sticking to commitments. they said it was shipped but was not given to ups for more than 3 days later. the hd support personnel were extremely helpful in resolving the issue.
1,should also include a map of where my package is at.
1,i received an order a few weeks ago at the store. they opened the package deliberately at the store before accepted it. i was not happy and told them. if they do it again. i will refuse it. this is my package bought and paid for and they do not have the right to open it. please advise
1,3 days my ass
1,still waiting on delivery.
1,ups recvd shipping info 3/1 yet its tracking has not updated.. has my package shipped yet???????
1,"an awful experience. apparently my shipment is lost and no one too help. but you had no problem charging me for it.
i ordered a small item that the store was supposed to have and obviously their inventory was messed up. computer showed 23 in stock. drove up and not a one. paid twice the amount of item for shipping. you let me down house store! i might be done. i ordered a similar item from lowe's. guess what! free shipping! oh yeah, and i actually got the order."
1,"still waiting, said it was delivered and i was house waiting.  they dropped somewhere but not my house!"
1,great addition to house store online ordering and shipping updates.
1,the 2 packages in this shipments were not delivered on the same day. instructions to leave the package by the back door were not followed and packages were left in plain view for anyone walking on the street.
1,not here on expected date.
1,"multiple ""weather"" delays in cities where there was not inclement weather. shipment required adult signature for no particular reason, further delaying delivery."
1,great addition to house store online ordering and shipping updates.
1,well the original delivery date was march 4. here it is now march 5 at 7:50 pm and still no delivery..  2 days of waiting for it and no show... i won't be ordering from house store on line anymore...
1,"you messed up the address, put the apartment number before my name, my name as the address, ups couldnt figure where to deliver it...so i had to track it down at the store myself. very unprofessional coming from a company that id imagined i could count on."
1,"i ordered all of these items at once, i have yet to receive half the things i need to complete my project. "
1,"it would be helpful to associate the tracking # with an item description, otherwise great service."
0,it was delivered a week in advanced
1,"my order was for a vanity, faucet, and this side splash. i have received emails notifications that the vanity and faucet were received but no email to advise that this side splash was received. i will call the store to check."
1,i never gotten any text that the item was delivered.
1,where the hell is my order?
1,"the ups tracking site is much better, yours hasn't been updated for more that 36hrs"
1,the package is in mesquite on the 4th and it's delayed until the 9th because of bad weather?? ridiculously lousy service!!!!!!!! sun is shining here and i don't see an issue when it is so close to me.
1,the right address is 10637 so. king drive not 10737.
0,outstanding.
1,i wanted this order canceled
1,received it late
1,"got a text on march 5, 2015 stating i'd received my package that day and didn't get it until 1 pm on the 6th of march"
1,yet another failed attempt.
1,"there was some light snow, not a blizzard. there shouldnt of been a day late delivery because of a little snow."
1,order was for 2 rolls of wire. one of the rolls had the plastic wrapping torn badly and the wire was damaged in some areas.
1,no tracking details
1,my package has not been delivered.  contacting ups did not help and an investigation had to be opened.  further delay of 8 days
1,where is my product?
1,my package sat 20 miles from my house at the local warehouse for three days because they kept changing the delivery date. they claimed severe weather troubles. all along ups trucks drove right by my house. i guess that one truck just couldn't make it to me. unbelievably the worst excuse i've ever heard.
1,"item arrived broken. now i have to wait till i return the item, then order another one then wait another 6-8 days to revieve it. "
1,"address is correct & complete.  not delivered. tfy again monday.
"
1,i recived a empty box
1,still waiting on the rest of the order.
1,i was very upset when it was left outside. my mother is 72 and could not lift this.  i would have been nice if they could have just put it in the door a little. now i have to go make sure it's still there and carry it inside.
1,last check said to expect delivery today. checked today and the delivery date is 3 days later.
0,excellent service. the notifications were extremely helpful. no surprises.
1,"package left on front porch, didn't wait at all for anyone to come to door so it could be left inside.  too heavy for occuupant, so i had to make an extra trip immediately to put it inside."
1,ordered over 9 days ago and ups still shows it not shipped . house store showedexpected delivery for 4 days earlier and it still hasn't shipped...the 2 worst experiences i've had in hundreds of online orders has hands down been house store only ordered twice and both have been the absolute worst online shopping experiences.  i never plan to buy anything from house store online ever again. they can't keep track of their own inventory or get something out within 9 days!! wow!!
1,"order somewhere ,who knows where .supposed to have a sunday am delivery .expect date to be changed."
1,shipping date keeps pushing back..  am i ever going to relieve this stove and will it be smashed again??  perhaps..
1,terrible
1,tracking showed online to arrive monday the 9th.  showed up on the 6th & told me they can't bring it in only 1 guy came.  i paid for delivery  what kind of service is this??  stated they will come back.  i will be reporting this to better business bureau as well as house store. regret buying from house store now.
1,i haven't heard any status on the dining table or motion chairs.
1,"the service was awful. we had to login to figure out delivery date, only thing we got was an e-mail. they just came in the morning threw harshly the stuff outside our door and left. didn't even bother to knock. the boxes were broken and damaged. we hope the stuff is in good condition. this is by far the worst delivery i have ever experienced."
0,"the delivery man was an exceptably friendly man!
"
1,"the estimated delivery date has  changed 3 times, with  each estimate fluctuating 7-10 days from the last estimate. no way to track detailed delivery status of package. very frustrating. this is why i prefer  amazon prime. "
1,"took over 2, weeks to get,delivered. that is way too long. will never ordwe,again."
1,"the delivery is so slow! it takes about 9 days to be arive! 
the delivery guy just drop the boxes outside! this is ridiculous!!!
i'm not happy with that service at all!"
1,maybe finally the nightmare will be over?  we'll see monday pm.
1,both boxes were damaged as well the items inside the boxs because delivery service.
1,"poor shipping info, defective product returned to store. store return was better than expected"
1,postponed our trip so as to receive delivery only to find out it will sit in houston for 4 days! better updating would have been appreciated.
1,the text message didn't work
1,"tracking told me that this shipment would arrive on wednesday, mar. 4. after checking tracking on wednesday, it said that shipment would arrive on thursday. thursday rolls around, and it tells me that it would arrive friday. friday rolls around, i get house at 4pm to find the package on the front step. at 10:02pm, i get the text notification saying that it was delivered. this will probably be the last time i order online from hd and have it shipped to my house. "
1,this is the last time i order from hd ..your shipping method is the worst ..i order 6 thing that came in 5 different package ..and i still do not know where my saw blades are ..no tracking record is available
1,the package was in badly beaten shape. upon opening found that the contents were crushed. the appearance of the package indicated it was tossed around a lot.
1,waited all day..almost 9pm..need to tell closer time. .had to wait all day
1,"the package was delivered at apt 628 in error.
"
1,expected delivery date went from mar 4 to mar 5. today is mar 6 at 7:55 pm and still no delivery... i would sure like to know when i can leave my house again.
1,ups always delivers !
1,the package was in badly beaten shape. upon opening found that the contents were crushed. the appearance of the package indicated it was tossed around a lot.
1,"the driver ring bell and left package on porch and drove off, disabled had to get someone to sit it inside door for me."
1,"the only recommendation i would have, is to flag ups to text or email at the time of delivery. i received the text several hours after. prefer the opportunity to come house and put it inside and lesson the risk of theft. otherwise, great."
1,this was the second refrigerator that i ordered because the first one that was damaged the second one came also damaged this has been the worst experience of my online ordering
1,"late as always, ill be surprised if the items are not damaged"
1,"i ordered 3 boxes. now the order status is delivered, but i only received 2 boxes."
1,"i need it sooner.
"
1,item was received broken. not too happy. the good news is i was able to return it to the store.
1,product was severly damaged
1,"i cancelled this order on 3/5 am. first rep disconnected me. second rep clearly assured me the order was cancelled. i then req a supvr to report the 1st rep disconnecting me and he too assured me this order was cancelled. however, tonight i see an email stating it was shipped. this is the last order i place or purchase with house store. this is totally unacceptable especially when mgmt also took this information. i demand a letter explaining how this was still shipped and an apology from the ""top"
1,package not deliverd
1,cool stuff
1,the text messages were severely delayed andn the guy didn't even ring our doorbell
1,we did not receive the package.
1,package was smashed oil all over everything pieces missing.
1,my product arrived damaged
1,"you are sending this order to the wrong address. we have called about this already. the correct address follows:
1300 schillinger rd. s. lot d-13
mobile, al. 36695
we have made several calls see that this is taken care of asap!"
1,"i paid extra to have this package delivered to me quickly.  i have a deadline on monday so i paid extra to get my shipment to me.  i understand weather issues, but, i also expected higher priority placed on my shipment to get my packages to me right away.  i'm disappointed in ups recovery."
1,brutal
1,it was delivered to mesquite texas and never left and we are in arizona so i don't see how it can be delayed due to weather. maybe back east but not here in the southwest.
1,"it was shipped twice with pedestal broke. 2 weeks late getting job finished. bought one at lowe's better selection in stock and no dang broken stuff. 

"
1,once again dropped off outside without letting us know they were delivered.  left outside in plain sight of anyone watching them be delivered.  left where the dog got to them and chewed the boxes.  could have / should have rang the doorbell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  not satisfied
1,last update march 5 today is march 7
1,this package was for pickup from house store.  not delivered to my house.  i have a security gate with diffcult access.  i now have to figure how to get this error corrected.
1,they was slow and come really late!
1,"it was due on the 6th, today's the 7th, im really hoping i receive it today !!!!"
1,"house store was great, ups not so much."
1,"considering i order this feb. 23rd and received notice that it shipped on feb. 24th and the tracking status has not changed since then and it's march 7th, i have no idea what the real status of my order is.  not a happy customer."
1,"leaving cardboard boxes in the driveway, when rain is coming, without letting the houseowner even know that they were delivered is just bad business.  this happens with every delivery you guys make.  boxes are all beat up, with holes in them, left outside in plain sight of the world without letting us know they are dropped off.  not satisfied"
1,"this has been the worst experience that i have ever had with the house store. i place an order, pay for shipping, get a delivery date, and 4 days after it was to be delivered i am still waiting and no one knows anything. i will make sure that everyone that i know is informed that once you place your order that house store does not take responsibility for the on time delivery and they don't care if you get your item or not. once it leaves the warehouse its out of their hands and they don't care."
1,no comments needed
1,missed delivery commit
1,damaged
1,can't believe i paid for 2nd day air!
1,"nice to be able to buy something for my daughter and have it shipped directly to her house, while i covered the billing payment."
1,the date is all jumbled on top of each other.  that is the most important thing on the page change to color to bright orange on the gray backdrop
1,i still don't have my order which was supposed to be delivered last wednesday.  i'm still waiting for the status to update on the ups site for the tracking number.  it hasn't changed since friday morning.
1,order not recieved
1,"i had a terrible experience the last 2 times having packages delivered by ups. no up to date tracking info, leaving me guessing when my package was to arrive. "
1,no info-worthless- order has shipped email doesn't mean shipped
1,i am totally disappointed that i cant get an approximate shipping date from louisville kentucky to nashville. the latest information is the package was scanned at 12:53 am on the 5th. today is the 7th and no more information is given even when i call ups.  i paid for expedited service and expect this chage to be refunded. lastly if i dont hear back from you i will order the same product from lowe's and return your order for a refund.
1,order was placed in january. it is now march and it still shows that it has yet to leave the origin. where is my shipment?
1,my shipment shows that it has been sitting in ga for a week. this is unsat!!!

where is it?!!"
0,the follow-up and tracking of every individual order has been excellent!
1,the date 8 march 15 has come and gone .the truck has not appeared.
1,i was told when i ordered this item. it could be put in an old one could be taken out. i ended up doing it by myself to find that the freezer and refrigerator door do not stick clothes. i was also speaking to someone online about this refrigerator being a normal regular standard size i'm not too good with measurements. the person online told me the size i got was standard and it is very small does not have a meat department in the refrigeratoi don't know how to have this returns and this fixed.
1,there has not been a status update on my order in two days and the delivery range is four days long it needs to be more precise and i need to be kept in the loop more about where my package is and an estimated delivery date and time very poor customer service
1,"order placed on feb 14 and was supposed to be delivered feb 26 - mar 2. it arrived at the delivery terminal on feb 25 and sat there. the carrier committed to a mar 3 delivery and i received notification it was on truck for delivery that morning. however package never arrived so i called the facility and they said the truck had issues and it would be delivered that day, march 4. package didn't arrive so i called on march 5  and was told a truck was down and wouldn't get package until march 7th. "
1,"i have still not received my order. apparently you had the wrong delivery address, which i corrected last week. i have received no information, no phone call, nor any email about delivery failures. please confirm this message and my expected delivery date."
1,"product was damage on deliver ,.not happy at all at this moment ,really sucks"
1,delivered on 02-26-2015 is wrong i got call this morning that items finally came in lat fri. or sat.
1,constantly changing delivery dates. unreliable shipper. waited on hold forever. package sat in milwaukee friday and i was told it wasnt ready for shipping monday morning. as a logistics scheduler myself i find this ridiculous. i now have to wait until wednesday the 11th to pick up a tub that was supposed to deliver on march 3rd. never again will i order from house store and have it shipped to the store. extremely dissapointed.
1,shipment delayed for over a week from original estimate.  not here yet and no reason given.
1,the truck driver was very professional and helpful.
1,you are not honoring your dates
1,when i ordered i was told shipment between 3/6 and 3/9.  now on 3/9 told delivery now 3/17 and 3/18!!!
1,i tracked the shipment no problem there. the problem is with house store not being able to find my item for me!!! took an hour of waiting. and it had just arrived an hour or 2 before i went to pick it up.
1,not happy. not on schedule whatsoever.
1,"ups has delivered all of our house store orders to the wrong address package after package! thus, we have to go and pick them up!"
1,4 days no update
1,still no tracking info......
1,"heater has not shipped, exception notice not issued. costing $40~50/day to heat to 50 f. delivery now not till 18th. the $2,000 + this is now costing me for a $300 heater is a bit out of bounds. any immediate action, monetary or else wise will be greatly appreciated."
1,"why not sooner??
"
1,i have never been disappointed with ups.
1,"as of mar/8, tracking details showed nothing after mar 4 . where is the merchandise?"
1,"from start to finish, a job well done.  i'll do more online ordering when necessary.  "
1,could be faster shipping
1,god
1,your carriers need to improve their tracking they at times take up to five days to update their tracking info
1,didn't get it
1,"mechanical failure?? i've had floor man here waiting and getting paid. first delivery was set for the 6th, then today the 9th, and now ups site doesn't have a date."
0,very dedicated driver
1,how did the package just ship 5 days after i placed the order?
1,the order was delivered before the tracking information was updated past shipping label created.
1,when i placed the order on the line it said the approxitmate delivery date was 3/10-3/11. now it was not shipped until 3/9 amd estimated delivery is 3/16. my tile installer is scheduled for 3/13. this is the same reason i closed my house store credit card. terriable service.
1,my shipment has been sitting in little rock arkansas for days now and it should have been delivered to bull shoals arkansas days ago.
1,"delivery date march 6th, this is the 9th.via phone ups says i have no package to be shipped. 
"
1,"no one called or emailed.
sloppy"
1,ridiculously slow even though this was paid for expedited shipping.
1,wrong part.
0,thank-you
1,"a couple of things:  1. my custom vanity top arrived broken!  now i  have to start again and reorder one.  3-4 weeks waiting with a vanity cabinet without top... 
2. the color finish is completely different from what i ordered: light coco,  #38050.  the top looks horrible displaying messy dark brown/purple brush stokes. i'm extremely disappointed. 
more, st paul cust service blames the mexican factory and cannot guaranty a finish that is even close  to what hd sales as light coco vanity top.  "
1,"ask questions once i get my product, im not giving out a fair rate until my order arrives. thank you"
1,no delivery date
1,just provide a link to ups.com. its an extra step going to your third party website...
1,"no llamaron a mi puerta, colocaron un aviso diciendo que yo no estaba, lo cual es falso pues aqui estaba esperando la entrega. ellos no me tocaron la puerta."
1,horrible!! suppose to be here on march 4 and has shown to be in sweetwater since march 2. now march 9 and i still don't have it. very unsatisfied
1,took forever to come. items i ordered from other website after i ordered this vanity already came. house store should use a more efficient transporter. this is a disgrace. today is tenth and nothing came yet.
1,"absolutely horrible experience so far and my product still hasn't delivered. seko has told me multiple times that i should be receiving a call from the white glove delivery company any minute now. that happened on 3/6 and again on 3/9. the tracking shows zero updates since 2/25, only that my product should deliver between 3/3-3/5. turn out that my product has been sitting at seko in el paso since 3/2 and has yet to be delivered to the white glove delivery company."

0,ok
0,delivery not rated because item in still in transit.
0,charlie elkins (?) the driver was really nice! he delivered my shower door in one piece & helped me put it in the garage. very courteous & helpful gentleman!
0,i like the easy shipment status and the text msg. of when i am about to get my item in the shipment.
0,"this was the best and most convenient way to track our package. 
it was timely and always current with where the package was and reasons for delays. "
1,"this was the worst experience i could have had. was told it was attempted friday for delivery, no it was not, told wrong phone number, no it is not....contractors waiting for vanity, finally  shows up monday...and yes of course the vanity is cracked, then i call and i am told they will send me a new house for a discount, but i have to pay for it, take the other broken one to the store. not that you care but i am a single woman, no way to get it to the store, i am having major surgery the 3rd"
1,"item that was delivered was completely damaged. shipping took longer than expected and when the item arrived, it was in bad shape."
1,a three day window for delivery is a bit much. i need to know an exact date so someone will be there
1,this order is coming freight delivery and it took a couple days after it shipped to even find estimated delivery range and tracking details haven't been updated in past 4 days.
1,"the statuses don't make sense. also, we were supposed to get our shipment within 5-10 days. it has been 12 days."
1,this tracking is dismal. i expect more detail and guaranteed day of delivery and time so i can plan  accordily.
1,the person i spoke to was very rude and had no people skills at all.     answer is never use estes for anything
1,all kinds of issues so far
1,no date and all i could see was call for date. package was almost a week late.
1,"this company and their service sucks. you can't even get in contact with them. not scheduling delivery at the time they said, postponed.  not happy at all."
1,terrible shipping company. even the date you show it was delivered is not accurate. very dissatisfied.
1,"delivered three days early!
ms linda the lady at the house store service counter could not have been any nicer or more helpful. she offered to have someone help me out to my car, (which i declined), however it was a very nice offer."
1,missing one package
1,i have not opened the packages to see if any tiles are broken. the boxes are overstuffed.
1,seems its never going to be shipped or info updated
1,"i purchased a lawn spreaderand had it shipped to my house by ups. the box was torn badly and one of parts was laying in my driveway in the snow. i was lucky that i seen it and brought it in, if not i would not have been able to opperate i my lawn spreader. i would suggest that the handler be more cautious in the future."
1,"still haven't recieved my package. it was initially delivered to the wrong address in the wrong 
state...."
1,"i failed to notice that the store taht the toiulet was being delivered to was in warrenton, oregon.  i have changed my ""house store"", several times but i didn't notice this time.  it would be helpful if youir ordering web site would ask to make sure that the store being sent to is appropriate.  what do i do now?????"
1,"tracking # said it was delivered friday the 20th. i did not receive package. the driver calls tues morning the 24th and says on monday the package was sent back to sender. i would like to know where the package was over the weekend since tracking said it was delivered on friday. if the driver delivered it to the wrong place, i would just like for him to be honest. thanks."
1,"not looking easy, too complicated if compare with other online store such as target, kohls. please improve shipping experience "
1,"it should be obvious from my ratings above.  i was hung up on, by a house store employee in brownsville when i tried to get some information."
1,i dont understand why my package sits at one place so long.
1,they said it was left went down stairs about five minutes after  they said it was left not to see anything. so you can tell me what my experience is. this is the first time this has happen.
1,"what the f....how do you leave pkg at facility...that is pure bullshit.
am not impressed"
1,tracking details report that shipment was delivered but it has not arrived here as of 1256 pm 24 feb
1,original estimated delivery date was way off (much longer).  not upset about getting my order earlier but i might consider other places to purchase if delivery time is not accurate..
1,one day my order said processing and then its out for a delivery. super fast shipping but i would like to know when it was being shipped so i can plan to having someone at my house to sign for the package. overall 9.5
1,package was delivered 6 hours before text notification. this does not help me keep my delivery secure.
1,"i can't really give 5 starts for experience since it isn't delivered, yet."
1,"boxes were left in the snow 300 feet from the house, covered with drifting snow. another hour later and i wouldn't have found them til spring or i hit them with the plow. not very happy with ups."
1,"as industrial materials in boxes weighing in at about 70 lbs each, these should not be sent via ups or fedex.  these product should either be sent surface freight or should not be allowed for house delivery.  ship to store should be free and then if house store wants to charge for delivery, that's fine.  why do i say this?  all three packages were severely damaged in transport and the products inside also sustained moderate damage.  one package of the three had missing hardware that probably just dropped out of the ripped box."
1,shipment is non-existent so far.
1,item was severely damaged. has to be picked up and shipped back. we are not happy at all
1,packages still no delivered. order was split on three trucks.
1,took 5 days on ups truck to deliver
1,your shipping of items takes to long to even get to a store. i have ordered items thru other companies and had my purchase within 2 or 3 days
1,"getting this message is frustrating knowing house store is open.
 feb 24, 02:40 pm
the receiving business was closed at the time of the first delivery attempt. a second attempt will be made.
san diego, ca "
1,could have been a bit quicker.
1,took forever to get pacakge. i went on vacation for a week and still have not gotten the package
1,what is the emergency that you can't deliver my package
1,ups never called me never was clear with delivery time just said close of business poor delivery service indeed.
1,i am not happy with this experience. the package arrived 2 days later than i was originally expecting it. it arrived around 4:30 p.m. and i didn't get a notification on my cell phone until 10:30 p.m. that night. it arrived in broken condition and we ended up returning it to house store for a refund.the whole point of the cell phone notification was so that we can plan on being house close to the time that it arrived.
1,after sitting at the service center for 2 days i offered to take the 35 min drive to pick the package up from the center after waiting in line for 20 mins i was told they want exactly sure where my package was (after cus service assured me) and the earliest they could have it would be 2-23-15 (6 days after sitting at the site) today is 2-24-15 and my package is final out for delivery. not sure if i even want the package at this point
1,the shipment arrived in a timely manner but the actual package was in poor shape. the box was ripped partially open and part of the workbench was exposed.
1,"house store never notified me when my package arrived to the store.  they say i will receive an email telling me my product is there.  no email, no text message, nothing.  i had to track my package."
1,delivered to wrong house. didn't know it had arrived until a neighbor down the street called and asked if i had ordered a ladder. not a good system.
1,"took forever to arrive... it's good nothing really special. tried it out on my pallets, works okay. it's a bit long and kind of awkward to handle but does the job. i would have bought something else if i had the opportunity to see it in stores instead of 'online only' which is kind of bs. kind of would like to know what i'm buying before i spend 75 bucks and wait longer than two weeks for it to finally show up. i give a 2 out of 5 for the shipping... again bs to wait two weeks for this. "
1,"bowl came 4 days after the tank even though they were shipped out the same time from the same warehouse. the bowl arrived broke... 
a real mess!"
1,going to pick it up at the store this evening! haven't gotten the email even though ups says it's there.
1,you said my package would be delivered today no way to check status its 6:01pm and no delivery wheres my package? will call customer service tomorrow not happy once again
1,"disappointed that the item arrived damaged.  not sure when the item broke, did not see a fragile content sticker on it.  ordered another and hope that it isn't damaged when it arrives in a few days"
1,i didnt recieve my packetage
1,unit on truck 5 days rough handling damaged .returned
1,shows it was delivered in houston ans stated had no idea when it would be delivered to my area beaumont
1,no tracking number provided that ups uses
1,why would hd use a shipper's like seko that refuses to provide tracking information?
1,this is horrible; today is the 24th and i have still not been notified as to when i can expect delivery. do i stay house from work for three days.  seems you could at least have narrowed it down by now... i mean really this is within the delivery dates and still can't determine when it will be delivered.
1,"i was under the impression the large items wouldn't be delivered until next week (~march 3i received no delivery information telling me otherwise yet came house last evening to huge boxes (2 vanities, 2 toilets) left blocking the sidewalk to my front door. i live alone so moving these boxes into the garage was very difficult. i understood that i would have the opportunity to open the boxes and check the merchandise for damagesi didn't get that opportunity. very disappointed. "
1,first the box was open. second it was just stuffed over the water heater. third i was house they did not ring the door bell or knock on the door. i opened my garage door ther it was appearing taller than garage door blocking my car. very displeased that i had to get out of my car and move the water heater so i could get my car out of the garage. bad customer service exactly what i expect from house store.
1,"actual deliveryman was great. 
the tracking info did not reflect the accurate status, however.
it was supposed to be delivered on monday - according to my tracking status, but didnt get delivered til wednesday.
also - it was a big window of potential delivery time : ""anytime before 5 pm"""
1,"i ordered this shower door feb. 12, i had another online order feb. 20 and was delivered to my house today so i don't understand why this order took almost 2 weeks ????"
1,the tracking does not give us any information.  i am glad i am not in a hurry for the vanity.  it is taking too long!!!!
1,this was the worst experience i ever had with a shipping company.
1,not satisfied the way the delivery man did it.very poor.....
1,"presumably weather delays but the  hd site tracking experience was marginal. 

fortunately the freight company's site and tracking number (estes) was linked and they had some limited info"
1,arrived damaged.  i refused item at store. it was supposed to be returned & a new one sent immediately?  it has been 2 weeks & i have not heard a thing.
1,"we were open at time of attempted delivery today so not sure why it says ""rescheduled due to holiday closure,"" frustrated. "
1,"i tried to postpone my delivery date by one day.  i went on the ups website but couldn't chat.  then i called the 800 number and was never able to talk to a real person.  i had a commitment that day and when i returned, there were 8 boxes at my front door.  i am 75 years old and live alone so had to get the dolly and struggle to put those 8 boxes in my garage.   very poor customer service by ups.  i will have to find another way to shop now so i won't have to count on ups for delivery. "
1,"no update since 2/18, now 2/24  "
1,store didn't even know it was delivered when my husband went to pick it up. it was delivered at 10:30 am and he went there after 6pm. he had to call me to get all the information and ask her to check with the dock to find it...they were not helpful in finding it had we not been persistent that it was there and had been delivered!! horrible pick up service!!!!!!! won't order again.
1,i'm not sure i understand why i could not have had this shipped to my house for no charge. it was delivered by ups to the house store store just a few miles away for free. if i wanted ups to deliver it to my house i believe the charge was going to be $55. the total project cost was 219.00
1,"if this has not been shipped, then please cancel the order and i will look elsewhere"
1,"ups should never deliver without ringing the houseowbers bell. they never ring the bell, so unprofessional. one of my salt bags had to medium size holes in it. "
1,"delivery failed to arrive to the address indicated. no email or phone call to notify me of the problems.  the delivery address is a valid address, and never have any issues before.  ."
1,i am frustrated..i have not received met order. there is no detail about estimated delivery either.
1,no package on 24 feb is the gd packaged coming or not?
1,the package was not on my front porch. it is no where to be found. very disappointed.
1,never got ups lost the shipment  and now the item is out of stock
1,the jar leaked. the plastic bag holding the jar leaked. paint everywhere when i opened the package. what a mess!
1,"this is 2nd shipment of same product, after first order arrived frozen solid.  the contents in this order had two badly dented cans.  i don't know if these come from the manufacturer like this or if it was damaged in the shipping process.  i've not had the best overall experience with the shipping process from house store. "
1,package delivered to wrong house.
1,not delivered yet :)
1,"we got this a long time ago, not sure why i received this email now..."
1,hurry up with my tools or i'll start taking my biz elsewhere. ...not happy
1,ups is not careful with fragile freight.  tracking updates too slow.
1,"the whole process was easy to follow my only complaint is that the original order was shipped incorrectly,  i received the wrong materials, which cost me a lot of time to correct, and caused my customer inconvenience. "
0,my gmail automatically opens this status. so convenient not to have to copy and paste a 75 character alpha-numeric code. :) good stuff.
1,this makes it easier to know when your merchandise has arrived
1,"purchased all items at the same time, got only 1 tracking number. no way to find other items i purchased but that they say shipped. got my email saying my order was delivered and left work to grab it. went house, only 1 item was delivered of the 5 or 6 i purchased. wasted time and gas for a flashlight expecting to have all my items."
1,the order was great and shipment was delivered earlier then the site said it would be.
1,two of the three can was slightly open which caused some paint to leak .
1,"very disappointing to order an item, be told when it should arrive and then find out 6 days later that it is just shipping now???  what's up with that??"
1,there were no updates of when the package would be shipped because of a delay.  when the package arrived the contents was broken.
1,"signing up for text message updates was a bust. i signed up several times but never received any updates. nice idea, flawed implementation."
1,"your email said the delivery will be  march 2 but the tracking info says the delivery will be feb 26 - so what is it????? - i'm not available tomorrow.  i press ""submit"" and nothing happens - strike 3."
1,i guess its ok to sell things that you dont really have in stock... then blame it on the weather! what a joke these vendors for house store are.
1,i paid for 2 day shipment and didn't get my item in 2 days
1,package was damaged!   now let's see how hard of a time that i'm given to fix he problem
1,please do not use ups. they play games with packages & hide them behind trees in random locations. this has been an ongoing problem for years. ups is extremely unreliable in this area.
1,how did it got missed delivered. it was delivered to your house store store. thank u
1,item broken!
1,this is probably my woest experience with ups. my package was suppose to be delivered two days ago and now today they are saying inclement weather is delaying the delivery. even though the package has been at the local delivery facility since 5am this morning. i actually watch two ups trucks drive by so how is it that my package is delayed again. weather delay my ass!!!
1,when the table arrived it had a dent in the side from one of the banding straps that must have been used to hold the skid of tables together. i didn't have time to return the table because i needed it right away. they should have placed a cardboard on the skid before strapping them all together then the soft wood on the table wouldn't get dented and crushed.
1,the blinds had black soot on them i had to wash each blind by hand
1,still do not have shipment - fedex is delivering - suite 296 was on order - can leave with neighbors on same floor if not in office upon delivery
1,very convoluted delivery route and it took over a week to receive a small package.
1,please do not text me for a rating again
1,"supposed to be delivered tuesday,2-24.  now they are saying it won't be here until after 5:0 on 2-27 so i won't be able to have installed until next week!  this is unacceptable.  the mirror sat in texas for four days."
1,"driver decided not to attempt delivery because of road conditions however our road was very clear of snow
i didn't trust him to come the next day so i made arrangementsto pick up myself"
1,"i was delivered the wrong merchandise. the box was damaged upon delivery, it had been re taped several times. upon opening the box, i discovered a roll of wallpaper."
1,my order was for six storage boxes and i only received one. i could have bought these at amazon or wal-mart and i am beginning to wish i had. i have not heard back from your company concerning this order and i guess i will need to call you again. this i not what i call good customer service.
1,was tossed over a 6 foot fence... at the neighbor's house!!!  not only was it left in a locked area at the wrong address... but it is very likely damaged from being dropped at a high distance!  i am shocked at this lack of respect and attention to detail!
1,my package never arrived!
1,"said it would be delivered on 2-23
said it would be delivered on 2-24 
it's 5:41 still not here on 2-24 why send me delivery dates if it's wrong
not happy once again!!!!!"
1,do not have yet.
1,not completely delivered. turf lawn not delivered and grass deodorizer is broken
1,"if my packages were shipped on the 19th, and today is the 25th..?. and ups only shows a label has been printed, is something amiss? "
1,slow shipping.
1,next time they should leave it at my door not at main door entrance. it's a two floor apt complex. and if they can't walk one flight of stairs they need not work at ups.
1,it is wednesday the 25th and you say it shipped with a delivery date of the 25th.  ups says the package is ready for pickup but has not been picked up.  someone is full of it!!!
1,ups delivered my package to the wrong address. my neighbor had to get my number from my package a call me to let me know it was delivered there. the package was properly labeled with the correct address.
1,order is still in transit...
1,house store has not been truthful concerning the shipment of this item.  i received emails stating it was shipped when it was still at the vendor.  this has been a horrible experience.  my contractors are about ready to install this and it is on the other side of the country!!!!  very poor house store experience.
1,"i lodged a complaint against hd for not effectively communicating delivery. when i got an email from hd indicating the items were delivered, i went to the hd status page only to find that the order status also said, ""delivered,"" when actually, it had only reached estes. nothing indicated that estes would contact me for actual delivery. to complicate the issue estes contracted delivery through a 3rd party whom i had to call. estes indicated they received many calls about this confusing info. "
1,first off i have also ordered another large item from lowe's. they have contacted me by phone to notify me that on the day of delivery they will call me to set up a delivery time. this way it's not just sitting outside. second i felt the delivery guy was kind of rude. when we unwrapped it the item was completely covered in ice. we were unable to use the item and had to call for service repair because during delivery my brand new item froze and got screwed up.
1,i am very upset. i ordered a summit gas range and the delivery date keeps being moved forward. it was supposed to be here today and it is not. your online customer support said they could not find the order number i provided and that i'd have to call my local store. i called them tonight and the shipper is not available. they said they will try to reach them tomorrow morning and call me. i'm also upset that house store won't allow this item to be shipped to the store for me.
1,"status doesn't tell you where it is - in transit is very vague. 
text only worked the last day when it was out for delivery. 
the system needs work to be customer focused. 

lonnie parker"
1,4 days late--still not here
1,received much later than expected.
1,"my tracking info stopped on feb 23. saying: feb 23, 03:27 pm 
 at delivery terminal 
where isis and whencan i expect it.  i don't live at the address and must know when it is arriving.  nothing here seems to be working!"
1,i got a text saying it would be delivered on wednesday so i waited all day nothing came so i called up the person i spoke with never herd of getting a text and it will be there tomorrow.thurs. came and i call at 1:00 they told my an hour hour &chaldean. it didn't come till 4:30.
1,"shipment arrived quicker than expected, however package was damaged and unusable.  now i have to reorder and wait another 2 weeks.  not very happy."
1,it was late and no one had the correct information on where it was. i'm happy to see it has arrived.
1,i do believe that you should also have free house delivery on items that are $200 or more instead of just free delivery to your store for me to pick up an item it's a two hour round trip thank you
1,please add email address to get package updates like your normal desktop website offers. the mobil version just offers texting
1,changing delivery dates!
1,i never recieved it. where was it delivered too?
1,the delivery date above stated it will be here today 2/26 but when i track the package through the link it states that it has not been picked up so which is it? overall experience with house store great just disappointed in the delivery info
1,"cannot comment on the delivery, as i have not received my order yet. but the fact that they contacted me within 6 minutes of my package leaving the facility was awesome. and it's coming 8 days early! bonus."
1,"package was not even ordered by the date it was ""delivered"".  wtf?"
1,didn't arrive...they delivered to our neighbors.
1,my order was broke and not usable. very upset this order was very important for family.
1,"first, ups delivered the package to the wrong address. i called to their customer service, and they went back for the package, but was they delivered to me was only one roll, while has to be 4 of them, 25% of my package. ups promised to take care of that and resolve the issue, and i am waiting for them to deliver me my whole package. will i receive it?! ups case #1-5343201410. i am so dissapointed"
1,"leave package at door, i never get a package from ups because they always claim to have ""missed"" receiver. just leave it !"
1,package was not delivered on time. wasted money for 2 day delivery.
1,please send my order. the estimated delivery date was 2/14/15-2/17-15. today is 2-26-15.
1,"i was told "" short of a metor hitting the truck. my package would be delivered feb 25th. "". it was approx 8pm at nite. short there after the status was changed to feb 26.. didn't see on the news about a ups truck being hit by a metor. 
 will only use fedex from now. they delivered on time. even during ice and snow"
1,"the driver banged on my door and when i opened the door he was already in his truck. he left the package at the front door sitting in snow/ice/water/salt/sand.
didnt even bother to wait for me to open the door or sign anything or even say hello. the item was heavyfor me to lift. my old ups guy was so pleasant. this guy dropped and ran so quickly i couldnt even tell u what he looked like. not impressed. i hope hes not the same guy who delivers an even heavier pkg to me tomorrow. "
1,didn't receive ítem today.
1,don't send me a text at 11pm to have me rate my experience
1,"ups driver did not deliver due to damage ,driver was at my house and drove off , i called ups & was told the driver told them, item,
sounded like broken glass ,
so he did not deliver & left in a hurry.
as i was sounding my car's horn,i guest he dropped the box breaking it."
1,"i have multiple items and tracking numbers, but there is no association between the two. which items are arriving when? who knows. also some of the shipping is over a week despite being within ca. too slow...."
1,"lady in charge of the shipping department was terrible, bad experience"
1,i am very disappointed in my product.  when i opened my big box and removed the 15-amp 12 in. sliding compound miter saw with laser guide box i noticed that the box was damaged and the handle on the saw is broken.
1,we didn't receive package
1,wayyy too slow.
1,order was delivered at 09:25 here it is 15:22 and it still hasn't reached the customer service desk
1,in case nobody at house on delivery please leave the item at the front door. thanks
1,got the text message at 10:40 at night after the package was delivered.  seemed a little late to me.
1,didn't get here as of 6:39pm what's up ?
1,the carpet was delivered on friday 20 and i was not house. ups left notice that it would be shipped on monday 23 well come wednesday i still didn't have a carpet. tracking number was wrong. after calling ups was told tracking number was wrong and they didn't know where my package was at. i am so disappointed. the guy and gal at ups were both of no help. was on line trying to figure out where my package was. neither of them could tell me at one point the gal said she was not sure what had happened
1,i was waiting in my living room for the package and it was left at my door. no one knocked or rang the door bell. if i didn't check the tracking status i would not have known it was delivered.
1,sub-par!  the first email from house store said to expect delivery march 3 - 5.  the next from hd said march 2.  then ups tracking told me yesterday to expect delivery today but i'm not house today.  today.  tried to straighten this out with hd but got a recorded message that hd was closed in atlanta because of the inclement weather.  strike three!
1,"the shipment tracking indicated that the item had been delivered to the store on the promised day. when i went to the store, they told me ""ups is always a day ahead of us"" (what?), and ""it's probably in the back.  the receiving clerk comes in at 8:00 tomorrow and will release it.""  i asked if i should come back the next day and was told ""yes"".  the next day i went to the store and it still had not been checked in by receiving.  i had to be assertive in getting someone to go in back to find it."
1,five star....thanks
1,i know we had snow here but it has been gone from the roads for nearly a week and my package has sat 20 miles north for 6 days. during that time i have seen numerous fedex trucks in my neighborhood.
1,"only 2 lights got delivered today.2 indivdual boxes, not 3.i ordered 3 and paid for 3.where is the third one?"
1,where is my purchase?   still waiting.......
1,ups left my packages out in the rain in front of my garage. needless to say my packages were soaking wet.
1,why did i get texts and emails starting the night of 23feb expecting my delivery next day 24feb maling me stay glued to my front door 24feb and calling ups as late as 10 pm 24feb when there was no delivery but when i called shipper the store.com was told ups will deliver 25feb instead making me stay glued again to door another day until delivery was done as late as 8 pm the 25feb not as texts and emails sent to me that informed delivery is 24feb the day prior???? very misleading and misguiding!!
1,this was supposed to be there by march 2nd....it better be or i will return as soon as it arrives. not to mention over $40. was supposed to be free shipping to me directly. not a happy customer.
1,this is ridiculous. i ordered 2 items at the same time. they were not very expensive but have become a ridiculous amount because you split the 2 up into two different shipments. so an item that was $1.98 became $6.90. ridiculous. i only ordered the $1.98 item because i was placing the order for the other item. i can see i will never use your online ordering again. i was not given the option to choose to ship separately if necessary. i would have of course denied it. i want the shipping refunded.
1,over a week to deliver...why?
1,"yeahh, this is not at all correct. it's february 2015, i sure hope it doesn't take 4 months to deliver."
1,if my package is supposed to come tomorrow why are there no updates?
1,package should be delivered to door not in front yard.
1,just wish time from order to delivery coul be made fastet.
1,tracking details should be on top
1,"i ordered this in january and never received it. it keeps saying it's reshipped, but never comes and the tracking numbers never work. "
1,the worst experience of my life estes delivery service is terrible. they lost my package tracking could not find it. when they did find it a day later the delivery is a nightmare. they kept telling me 2 hours turn out to be 10 hours later. house store needs to use ups or fedx these fly by night delivery companies don't cut it. this is not house store level of service.
1,the shipment was damaged.  in particular the marble top to the cabinet was snapped in two pieces.  we have made a replacement request for this item with house store.  the mirror was somewhat damaged and the cabinet itself had some edges that were rubbed/damaged.
1,out for delivery from 12:36pm to 5:49pm on 02-24-15 with a damaged container. will not use wood from another state again. all containers damaged by carriers ups and seko. product damaged and not pristine or high quality as advertised. will not shop sight unseen from this vendor again!
1,"as this shipment is ~1 week late, we have a timing conflict with the scheduled delivery date and would like to request later or earlier delivery.  seems the package has been sitting for 3 days at 'delivery terminal' and waiting without explanation of delay is a frustration and inconvenience."
1,you should give a better time for delivery. i had a span from friday - monday when it was out on delivery. do you expect people to stay house 2 days?
1,did not receive packages on time returned them!!!!!!! not good service!!!!
1,no updates since date of order.  where is my shipment
1,"the tracking details are hard to understand.  for instance, it says on feb 27 at delivery terminal.  what does this mean?  delivery term where?"
1,"there is no information tracked other than it left the shipper.  so, there is no way to gauge or estimate what day the shipment will arrive, which makes it hard to prepare for being available to receive the shipment."
1,terrible unprofessional employee with an attitude. i will be sure to never use this service and let house store know about our experience.
1,everything was fine with the service up until the actual delivery. first they tried to deliver to the neighbors house. once we finally convinced them that they were at the wrong house they then refused to drive down our drive way due to a shallow puddle in the gravel. they then left the mower directly in the center of said puddle effectively blocking our driveway.
1,"worst shipping experience ever!!!! called carrier warehouse to provide directions and they said they would not be shipping it, someone else would be.  asked if i could provide directions and all he wanted to take was my phone number.  "
1,there is no helpful information provided in this link.
1,originally was told in store on 23rd of february and now its really late. my client is very upset and you may have made me loose future business. thanks!!!!!
1,"the package arrived damaged to the extent that the snow melt i ordered was unusable. the jug was less than half full, with most of the contents on the box. the clerk told me she ""couldn't guarantee"" i would get a replacement jug by the time the next ice storm hits. so-i waited a week for this ice melt and now i have to wait another week and make another trip to the store because incompetent boob didn't take proper care of the package?  i am livid!!!!! "
1,this has not yet been received.
1,"yesterday, the tracking screen said this item was going to be delivered... it didn't happen.  i am hoping that the item will be delivered today... "
1,only 13 of 14 packages delivered. they make one delivery of 12 packages of laminated flooring  then later  delivered package of transition molding. i do not have package of quarter round
1,"submitted to ups on 2-23 and today 2-27, they have not told of a delivery date !!!! da"
1,ladder was completely broken with a bent first step and product is not usable.
1,"delivery originally scheduled for 2/24, then revised to 2/25 and then lost in status (now 2/27)"
1,"if i could've had fedx deliver, i wouldve. not a fan of ups."
1,the package was damaged. it had been repaired with packing tape. there were no instructions in the box. the battery and charger were loose in the box. the jacket was wadded up in the box. there was also what looked to be dog hair on the jacket. not pleased with what i received .
1,package never arrived - not sure where it was delivered
1,package was delivered wet and muddy.
1,ups driver dropped the package at the entrance to my drive in the melted snow and mud (house is 300 feet from road)
1,package was open and walked on and dropped in snow.
1,"status shows ""delivered"". ordered three packages of ceiling planks. received two packages on 2/25. third package missing. called customer service. they said it showed one package not delivered yet. should arrive next day (2/26). package was not delivered on 2/26 or 2/27, even though tracker shows all three delivered."
1,i received no notification that my order had been received
1,"your tracking is the best of any company i order from!  the only thing missing is the estimated delivery time window which ups provides on its site.

having said that, why are the estimated delivery dates when i order so far in advance and apparently unrealistic?  this actual delivery is a week before your order-time estimate.  your long estimate almost led me to obtain the items elsewhere."
1,"staged in transit ?  i might guess truck was involved in an accident ?  
i may need to order from a local source - to get materials in a timely way . can i cancel this order ? "
1,order arrived incomplete. bill of lading indicates on site 5 were shipped but only two arrived with a bill of lading supporting only two....no back order information
1,where's my package?
1,"the package came with both ends torn open and the blind was slipping out  and some pieces falling out.!!!! the driver should keep duck tape with them so they could have fixed so nothing would fall out,!!! poor customer service they had to see this!!"
1,you should knock on the door to ensure someone is house to receive the product!!!!!
1,item and packaging was damaged.  item has been returned.    item was broken and dented in many places.     house store .com customer service and my local house store store manager went to great lengths to resolve this issue for me.     my faith in u.p.s. as a shipping option has been greatly diminished.
1,this status update says delivered.  my one hour round trip to the store was for nothing.  the package was not there!  anyone want to tell me why? your customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
1,twice delayed today there wasn't any snow but they decided after having it on the truck out for delivery not to deliver it.  ups is not a good option.  us postal service is more reliable.  fedex was out making deliveries today go figure
1,"this is the worse ever service 
house store failed even to explain to me what is going on rather saying we are sorry 
very bad experience costing me a lot "
1,"after the package was delivered to store customer service desk could not find it for me to pick up., :( "
1,delivered to the wrong house.   found at the neighbors side door.  was not  convenient to move.
1,ups used weather as excuse wednesday when roads were fine. this delayed package even more when real weather hit the next day.
1,i am waiting and it is installation date.no delivery.
1,once again hope store cannot find my order inside the store
1,"i could not get an accurate status, rec'd no text messages even though i signed for them, and the box was delivered the day before the date i was finally told it would be here. and the box was pretty well beat up. next time, i will drive two hours and pick it up myself."
1,your lack of communication was very frustrating. i signed up for tracking texts nd only got notified of delivery  5 hrs late.  will never use your delivery service again. atg will be my choice.
1,"when ordered it said 1 day shipping. then after order was placed no info on tracking for several days then it said delivery was 27th, and started moving back from there. that is why overall experience was low"
1,was the worst communications skills ever
1,very bad service
1,"where is our biscuit toilet? it was supposed to arrive at ranson, wv house store last week. we were promised it would arrive yesterday 02/27/2015. this has been a very frustrating process!"
1,package was not in the store as stated delivery never took place two days after alleged delivery the package was still not there it's special  arrangements to pick up the package and when we went to the store was told that it never arrived even though i got an email confirming that it was delivered two days earlier
1,"package was set to arrive on 2/23, when i finally called the shipping company on 2/27 they said that the package had just arrived at the dock and then it wouldn't arrive until at least monday or tuesday.  i asked if i could come to them and get it,  they had agreed.  when the guy loaded it in my truck,  instead of asking for another coworker to help guide the large pallet in he did it himself.  he hit and broke the taillight in my truck and didn't tell me.  i didn't find out until arriving house"
1,shipment arrived at store damaged apparently when it was loaded on truck other items placed on top of it & damaged hydronic lines. fluid leaking everywhere. now waiting to reorder again & have shipped by another carrier. will not recommend estes to anyone.
1,initial delivery date est was 2/19-2/23.once order complete that changed to 2/23-2/25. it's now 2/28 and no one answers the 391-7874#.i paid extra for this house delivery and i'm pissed!
1,delivery was scheduled for 10-4 and the driver did not show up until after 6.
1,ridiculous system . i ordered door to be delivcered to hd store. door arrived at carrier estes  on 26th feb i called 28th assuming to pick it up at hd store. estes told me it would be delivered to house store the next week ! you need at better carrier !! wont do this again
1,have not been notified of my package being damaged.  terrible service.
1,order placed 2/16. it is now 2 28 and no change in shipment status since order date. that is this all about?
1,delayed delayed and delayed. shipment was slow to start with then delayed a couple times
1,keeps telling me that my order has shipped to the left of this survey but when i go to ups it has not even been picked up per info.
1,suppose to show up monday february 23 and it is now saturday february 28 and still no package
1,they delivered in adverse driving conditions. excellent
1,"not delivered to my house on 27.2.15, despite order status indicating ""delivered""."
1,poor packaging and or rough treatment of package led to broken paper punch
1,ordered this light twice and came broken twice terrible terrible what a waste of time
1,i was very disappointed to see my shipment sitting on my doorstep today open for the public to see. anyone could have taken the box off of my doorstep. the outside of the box clearly stated that a signature was needed for delivery and to inspect the box for damages before approving delivery. pure laziness and carelessness. will not be ordering again
1,how is a package going to set at a location for two days before departing.
1,box was beat up (had a hole in it ). but lucky it works.
1,the package has been delivered yet so i can't rate the overall shipment delivery experience
1,house store tracking page was no help.   i went to ups page to get information.
1,worst online shopping experience ever.
1,order was delayed
1,i paid $11.43 to receive my merchandise in 8 days.  i wasted my money.  free shipping would have arrived next year.
1,product was damaged
1,"alot of miscommunication where the package status.  i been told order will deliver 3/3/2015 by live chat.  email said it just deliver today with tracking number. at the door, the package there on the same day.  it doesn't make sense. "
1,need to improve on the text messages. i signed up for them and didn't get them like you are supposed to.
1,expected delivery date came and went and no update
1,was never text alerted and ups will find anyway to avoid working and delivering.  fed ex delivered same day.  perhaps they are a better service.
1,"package has been in austin since 2/26 and can not get delivered.  what would happen if i really needed this item. tell ups to go to hell, i worked outside today and those lazy asshole can't drop off a package."
1,i wis h i had a time frame when it wouldbe delivered
1,most upset. package arrived severly damaged. photos were taken of the damage and i will be contacting house store for resolution.
1,store had a sample of the product assembled but missing pieces. therefore i was able to see the bbq before ordering it online. seeing it first was important so don't discount the importance of brick and mortar in retail.
1,so slow service
1,"they posted the sewing machine was a ""full size desktop sewing machine"" but was a mini travel machine.  not happy,  was mismis-represented."
1,"package in dallas,tx  since the 27th but not being delivered until the 2nd"
1,"i had to call to set up delivery date.
told person on phone to call my cell phone before driver was to arrive, that never happened.  signed up for text alert and i didn't get that until 3 hours after it was delivered. "
1,"online tracking info indicated delivery friday; called house store twice. first rep gave me wrong number for estes (a fax number), second rep was helpful but could not find out when my order would be delivered.  called estes today; on hold for about a half hour; hung up, sent online message. have not yet gotten a response.  order status says in-transit, last update feb 28 at 8:15 but tracking info says sorry, can't tell me when it will be delivered.  very frustrating."
1,way to slow to update.
1,"this shipment was horrible. the package left the origin promptly but sat almost a week at the delivery terminal. not a single call was, to my knowledge, received for delivery appt. only after calling the terminal directly, i negotiated a delivery. the final handoff was made by a very pleasant driver, to be fair. i am not likely to ever buy anything at the house store which requires freight delivery."
1,"originally they said it would be delivered on the 27th of feb, which would have been great seeing it was only coming from nj. the they called on friday and said it was in shrewsbury ma which is a half hour from here and said it won't be here until monday. why does it have sit in shrewsbury all day and why can't they at least deliveer it on saturday !! it's snowing now and i will wish i had my snow blower !! very disapointed... now with the snow it probably won't get here tomorrow either.... :("
1,shipment date changed three times before actually being delivered.
1,delivery delayed for a week without explanation and no longer displaying status.
1,appt was set up for 2/27/15 between 10am and 2pm...they did not show...did not call either.
1,"it has been 1 week over delivery date and i still do not have my product. when i called seko, they don't even know where my product is. "
1,9 small tiles way to long to ship. should have been here by now!!!
1,where is my package????
1,the mirror was scratched and cracked when we received it. we had to return it to the store and order another one.
1,i didn't get my shipment :(
1,been at the same location for two days this is ridiculous
1,"this is the 3rd time that this sink has been ordered for me. the first came to my house in sedona, poorly packaged & broken. called hd, dropped off the broken sink at the cottonwood store where it was credited. a 2nd sink was sent to the cottonwood store. i went to cottonwood again to pick it up, about a week later. packaged much better, broken far worse (checked it at the store). customer service credited it and reordered it. it is now on the way the yuma, and nothing can be done.  why?"
1,the ratings i gave are only because the order was just scanned at your location...
1,arrived to pick up shipment at store and only the granite top arrived and not the rest of the kitchen island.
1,ups did not deliver to the correct door and someone else denied my package. i still want the delivery.
1,slow shipping on products plus charge to house when others are free
1,its been a month waiting for my product. the first time it got lost and now the second time its the weather. i feel i should be credited completely for this product. disappointed.
1,for four days it tells me 'it just shiped!' and cannot find shipment info.
1,"i have been looking for an update since the 26th when it said delayed because ups was late. i would have paid extra for faster if i knew it would not be at my house on the 2nd. i have even thought about trying to find out what warehouse it is in and driving to it, but i dont know where it is at."
1,"since i cannot give less than a star. this is the 1st time i've ever had a problem with delivery.  my pkg was to be delivered 2/25 and was delayed due to weather; understood.  rescheduled for 2/26, again delayed due to weather;  okay. rescheduled to 2/27, pkg a no show; no excuse. rescheduled to 2/28, no show; no excuse. the ice/snow have been melted and gone since early 2/27. now says pkg will not be delivered until 3/4! that is 3 business days! why not on 3/2? this is ridiculous! "
1,"flooring arrived on pallet.  pallet loaded onto our truck.  many, many boxes of flooring are gouged on the sides and ends ultimately resulting in a lot of damaged flooring pieces.  not pleased!"
1,never got a tracking number in email stating my order has shipped. this was 10 days ago. item did not show up in specified time.
1,package is way late.
1,i rejected the shipment because the box was ripped open and there was evident of both water and rodent damage.
1,wont order on line again.  every time is a pain the the butt.
1,my shipment has been in transit 4 days without knowing where it is in-transit.
1,two weeks?  seriously?
1,"i have been in chat contact 3 times with hd on this order, i realize demad is very high and possible shortages, but a real status would be good, instead of stating it shipped, but no ups tracking data. "
1,this package was in 4 different p.o.'s in tenn. then 4 different p.o.'s in tx. what is going on anyway??? how long is this going to take?
1,"cant tell when products will arrive as tracking says ""exception"" and nothing more. says expected delivery is march 3 but has said that since when i placed order"
1,delivery is delayed even though other ups packages were received .
1,can we please get an update regarding this shipment. thanks.
1,"when each order number is opened, it should show all the items shipped.  we have a considerable number of items ordered, so it is difficult to know what items each number represents."
1,"i knew exactly where my package was and it was delivered on the date it said it was going to be , very pleased"
1,unacceptable. product was damaged. had to return and reorder
1,ok
1,haven't received it yet.
1,"damaged, reordered and original returned to local store."
1,if it was delivered why haven't i had notice of it yet????
1,"if there were an option for o stars on the delivery experience i would click that.  tracking status said friday the 27th last week as early as wednesday.  i spoke with estes 3 times, and even took the day off on friday.  i also clicked on the ""receive shipment status updates via text"", but have yet to hear anything from them.  i had to contact them on friday morning twice.  long story short, i am going to have to take another day off. "
1,"the tracking details you have provided make no sense, i have received only the single door, still waiting on the double yet your details are so confusing that they don't reflect what actually is going on"
